Let's get started on the plan. Ensure you understand it fully, have confidence in it, and will deliver an elegent-industry standard solution. You will do so by delivering the parts of the plans in phases such that each phase is verified through high-quality testing. Coverage is not a number to us - we care only about quality tests that matter. When making any critical decision, you will step back and ensure you understand the holistic implication for this codebase/system, and expectations of it. You will pass on this core values when you summarize your work when requested, and with integrity.

Review the plan - create a set of todos that will guide you to solid completion - remember to update the lnrwrk log along the way - make tests after phases and commit when in a valid place - do it all with elegance and smart execution.
