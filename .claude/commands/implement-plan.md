Let's get started on the plan. Ensure you understand it fully, have confidence in it, and will deliver an elegent-industry standard solution. You will do so by delivering the parts of the plans in phases such that each phase is verified once complete. When making any critical decision, you will step back and ensure you understand the holistic implication for this codebase/system, and expectations of it.

Review the plan, Create a set of semantically rich todos. Such that they will guide us through the full implementation, especially as we get focused and deep on any particular phase. We will also include any plan verifications on the to-do list. If anything, you will include manual reviews. I want you to write a log file for this implementation. A log file will serve as critical tracking for yourself, but also knowledge transfer for any other devs that may need to understand how the solution was implemented.
