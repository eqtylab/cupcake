# System Discovery & Understanding

Your goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of this codebase so you can effectively contribute to its development.

## Objective

Develop a robust mental model of the system's architecture, core workflows, data flow, and key components/modules - understanding how they interact and function together. Your understanding should be good enough to confidently tackle diverse development tasks.

## Getting Started

The main directory is now within `/cupcake-rewrite`.

Start with: ! `tree -a --gitignore --dirsfirst -I '.git'` to map the repository structure, then review recent documentation to understand the current state and what's next to be implemented.

## What You're Building Toward

Once you've explored and synthesized your understanding, provide a structured summary covering:

- **System Overview**: Purpose and high-level architecture
- **Core Workflows**: How entities flow through the system (ux/api)
- **Key Components**: Major modules and their responsibilities

Use whatever discovery approach feels most effective - you have full autonomy over your investigation strategy. Focus on understanding the system well enough to feel confident in beginning any new contributions.

Take your time, think critically, and leverage your strengths in code analysis and pattern recognition. No coding during this phase - pure discovery and understanding. Use to-dos as needed. Create to-dos along the way when you discover things you need to understand.
