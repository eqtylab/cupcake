# Cupcake Python/Node.js Library Implementation Log

## Overview
This log tracks the implementation of Python and Node.js bindings for Cupcake, following the LIB_APPROACH.md blueprint.

**Start Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Target**: Python MVP with thread-safe core refactor  
**Key Versions**: 
- OPA: v1.7.1
- PyO3: 0.26
- Rust Edition: 2021
- Python Support: 3.9-3.13

## Critical Requirements Verified
- ✅ OPA v1.7.1 binaries available with SHA256 checksums
- ✅ PyO3 0.26 is latest stable (not 0.23)
- ✅ Workspace feature flag syntax: `--features cupcake-core/deterministic-tests`
- ✅ Current WasmRuntime requires `&mut self` - MUST be fixed for thread safety

---

## Implementation Activity Log

### 2025-08-29 - Initial Discovery & Planning

**09:00 - Codebase Analysis Complete**
- Analyzed current single-crate structure in `/cupcake-rewrite`
- Identified 3 core modules: engine, harness, trust
- Found critical thread-safety issue: `WasmRuntime::query_decision_set(&mut self, ...)` at line 93
- Confirmed Engine::evaluate also uses `&mut self` - cascading mutability problem
- Located 21 files with unit tests using `#[cfg(test)]` blocks
- Integration tests in `tests/` directory (14 test files)

**09:15 - Thread Safety Analysis**
```rust
// CURRENT PROBLEM (line 93, wasm_runtime.rs):
pub fn query_decision_set(&mut self, input: &Value) -> Result<DecisionSet>

// Line 120: Store is created inside but self is still mut
let mut store = Store::new(&self.engine, ());

// SOLUTION: Remove mut, Store creation is already inside method
pub fn query_decision_set(&self, input: &Value) -> Result<DecisionSet>
```

**09:30 - Workspace Migration Mapping**
```
Current Structure → New Workspace Structure:
src/engine/*       → cupcake-core/src/engine/*
src/harness/*      → cupcake-core/src/harness/*  
src/trust/*        → cupcake-core/src/trust/*
src/lib.rs         → cupcake-core/src/lib.rs
src/main.rs        → cupcake-cli/src/main.rs
tests/*            → cupcake-core/tests/*
Cargo.toml         → Split into workspace + 4 crate Cargo.tomls
```

**09:45 - OPA Binary Management Design**
- OPA v1.7.1 provides 8 platform binaries with SHA256 checksums
- Key binaries for Python wheel distribution:
  - `opa_darwin_amd64` (67.3 MB) - macOS Intel
  - `opa_darwin_arm64_static` (43.8 MB) - macOS Apple Silicon  
  - `opa_linux_amd64` (67.1 MB) - Linux x64
  - `opa_windows_amd64.exe` (98.7 MB) - Windows
- Download URL pattern: `https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases/download/v1.7.1/[binary_name]`

**10:00 - Python Package Structure Finalized**
```
cupcake-py/
├── Cargo.toml              # PyO3 0.26, depends on cupcake-core
├── pyproject.toml          # Maturin configuration (primary)
├── src/
│   └── lib.rs              # PyO3 bindings with GIL release
├── cupcake/
│   ├── __init__.py         # Python API facade
│   └── installer.py        # OPA v1.7.1 downloader with checksums
└── tests/
    └── test_integration.py # Cross-language tests
```

**10:15 - Phase 1 Workspace Migration Complete**
```
✅ Created workspace root Cargo.toml with resolver="2"
✅ Created cupcake-core crate (engine, harness, trust modules)
✅ Created cupcake-cli crate (main.rs with cupcake-core dependency)
✅ Moved all tests to cupcake-core/tests/
✅ Moved benchmarks to cupcake-core/benches/
✅ Workspace builds successfully
```

**Build Output**: Workspace compiling with 100+ dependencies. Key observations:
- wasmtime 35.0 pulling in expected dependencies
- Trust system (sha2, hmac) properly included
- PyO3 not yet added (Phase 4)

---

**10:30 - Phase 2 Thread-Safety Refactor Complete**
```
✅ Removed &mut self from WasmRuntime::query_decision_set
✅ Updated Engine::evaluate chain to use &self
✅ Verified Store creation already inside method (line 120)
✅ Moved trust CLI to cupcake-cli (was causing build errors)
✅ All warnings fixed, workspace builds cleanly
```

**Thread-Safety Achievement**: The engine is now fully thread-safe:
- `WasmRuntime` creates fresh `Store` per evaluation
- `Engine` methods use `&self` allowing concurrent access
- No more mutable borrows blocking parallelism

**10:45 - Phase 3 BindingEngine FFI Layer Complete**
```
✅ Created cupcake-core/src/bindings.rs
✅ Implemented BindingEngine with Arc<Engine> for thread safety
✅ Added evaluate_sync using current_thread runtime
✅ Added evaluate_async for async language bindings
✅ String-based errors for FFI compatibility
✅ Compile-time thread safety assertions (Send + Sync)
```

**Design Highlights**:
- `current_thread` runtime avoids thread-local storage issues
- JSON in/out for maximum language compatibility
- Both sync and async methods for different binding needs

## Next Steps Queue

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Create cupcake-py crate with PyO3
2. **CRITICAL**: Implement py.allow_threads() for GIL release
3. **THEN**: Create OPA v1.7.1 installer
4. **FINALLY**: Integration tests across languages

## Blockers & Risks

- **Risk**: Store creation overhead per evaluation
  - **Mitigation**: Wasmtime optimized for this pattern, Module remains shared
  
- **Risk**: Breaking changes during workspace migration  
  - **Mitigation**: Move files without modification first, then refactor

- **Risk**: Python GIL not released causing freezes
  - **Mitigation**: MUST use `py.allow_threads()` wrapper

## Performance Targets

- Thread Safety: Support 1000+ concurrent evaluations
- Latency: <5ms overhead vs direct Rust
- Memory: Shared Module, ephemeral Stores
- Distribution: <150MB wheel size (includes OPA binary)

---

**11:00 - Phase 4 Python Bindings MVP Complete**
```
✅ Created cupcake-py crate with PyO3 0.26
✅ Implemented PyPolicyEngine with CRITICAL py.allow_threads()
✅ Created Python package with sync/async API
✅ Implemented OPA v1.7.1 installer with SHA256 verification
✅ Platform support for macOS, Linux, Windows (x64/ARM)
```

**GIL Release Verification**: The `py.allow_threads()` wrapper in `evaluate()` is properly implemented, ensuring Python web servers won't freeze during policy evaluation.

**OPA Installer Features**:
- Downloads correct binary for platform (67-98MB)
- SHA256 checksum verification for security
- Caches in `~/.cache/cupcake/bin/`
- Falls back to system OPA if available

## Implementation Phases Status

## Key Achievements

### Thread Safety
- Removed all `&mut self` from evaluation path
- Fresh `Store` per evaluation for WASM isolation
- `Arc<Engine>` enables safe concurrent access
- Verified with thread safety demo script

### Python Integration
- **CRITICAL**: `py.allow_threads()` releases GIL during evaluation
- Supports Python 3.9+ via stable ABI
- Both sync and async APIs
- Platform wheels for macOS/Linux/Windows

### Developer Experience
- Single command test: `just test`
- Python development: `just develop-python`
- Comprehensive debugging guide
- Example scripts for all patterns

## Build Instructions

```bash
# Build everything
cargo build --workspace --release

# Build Python wheel

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Publish to PyPI**: `maturin publish`
2. **GitHub Actions**: Automate wheel building for all platforms
3. **Performance Benchmarks**: Verify <5ms overhead target
4. **Integration Tests**: Test with real policies
5. **Node.js Bindings**: Follow same pattern with NAPI-RS
