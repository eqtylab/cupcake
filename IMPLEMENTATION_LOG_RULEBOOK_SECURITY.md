# Rulebook Security Guardrails Implementation Log

**Date:** 2025-09-03  
**Implementer:** Claude Code  
**Feature:** Rulebook Security Guardrails Builtin Policy  

## Overview

This log tracks the implementation of `rulebook_security_guardrails` - a new builtin policy designed to prevent Claude Code from modifying any Cupcake configuration files (.cupcake/ directory contents).

## Requirements Summary

**Primary Goal:** Prevent all modifications to Cupcake's configuration directory  
**Scope:** Block file operations (Edit, Write, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit) and dangerous Bash commands  
**Security Level:** HIGH severity blocking with immediate halt  
**Integration:** Full builtin integration with Rust config support  

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Architecture Analysis ✅
- **Status:** Complete
- **Goal:** Understand existing builtin integration patterns
- **Discoveries:**
  - **Builtin Registration:** Add new config struct to `BuiltinsConfig` in `builtins.rs`
  - **Signal Generation:** Implement in `generate_signals()` method using naming pattern `__builtin_<type>_<identifier>`
  - **Init Command:** Policies are embedded as string literals in `init_command()` function in `main.rs`
  - **Policy Location:** Builtins go in `.cupcake/policies/builtins/` directory
  - **Configuration:** YAML config in `guidebook.yml` under `builtins:` section

### Phase 2: Core Policy Implementation ✅
- **Status:** Complete
- **Deliverables:**
  - ✅ `rulebook_security_guardrails.rego` policy file created
  - ✅ Complete pattern matching for file operations (`Edit`, `Write`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit`)
  - ✅ Robust Bash command detection with 25+ dangerous patterns
  - ✅ Path obfuscation resistance (handles `./././.cupcake/`, normalization)
  - ✅ Signal integration for configurable messages and paths

### Phase 3: Rust Configuration Support ✅
- **Status:** Complete  
- **Deliverables:**
  - ✅ `RulebookSecurityConfig` struct with enabled, message, protected_paths fields
  - ✅ Integration with `BuiltinsConfig` (added field + validation + enabled detection)
  - ✅ Default configuration values (.cupcake/ protection, standard message)
  - ✅ All integration tests pass (signal generation, enabled detection, validation)

### Phase 4: Signal System Integration ✅
- **Status:** Complete
- **Deliverables:**
  - ✅ `__builtin_rulebook_protected_message` signal for configurable denial message
  - ✅ `__builtin_rulebook_protected_paths` signal for dynamic path configuration (JSON)
  - ✅ Signal timeout configuration (1 second for simple output)
  - ✅ Integration tests verify signal creation and commands

### Phase 5: Init Command Integration ✅
- **Status:** Complete
- **Deliverables:**
  - ✅ Policy deployment in `cupcake init` (added to main.rs constant and write operation)
  - ✅ Policy copied to canonical examples/.cupcake/policies/builtins/ location
  - ✅ Init command integration test updated to expect new builtin
  - ✅ Manual verification: `cupcake init` creates all 5 builtin policies including rulebook_security_guardrails

### Phase 6: Testing & Verification ✅
- **Status:** Complete
- **Deliverables:**
  - ✅ Comprehensive integration tests (rulebook_security_integration.rs)
    - File operation blocking (Edit, Write, MultiEdit, NotebookEdit) 
    - Bash command pattern detection (25+ dangerous patterns)
    - Path obfuscation resistance testing
    - Safe operation allowance verification
  - ✅ End-to-end engine integration with signals and configuration
  - ✅ All existing tests updated and passing

## Critical Decisions Log

### Decision 1: Input Field Access Pattern (Phase 1 Verification)
- **Decision:** Use `input.tool_input.file_path` for file operations and `input.params.command` for Bash commands
- **Rationale:** Confirmed by examining demo/file_protection.rego and never_edit_files.rego patterns
- **Impact:** Ensures consistent access to Claude Code tool parameters across all builtins

### Decision 2: Policy Testing Strategy (Phase 2 Verification)
- **Decision:** Create comprehensive OPA unit tests covering all security patterns
- **Results:** All 4 core tests PASS (file operations, bash commands, normal operations, path obfuscation)
- **Impact:** Confirms policy logic correctly blocks threats while allowing legitimate operations

## Technical Discoveries

### Builtin Integration Pattern (Phase 1)
1. **Configuration Structure:** Each builtin has its own config struct (e.g., `NeverEditConfig`, `GitPreCheckConfig`)
2. **Signal Naming:** Pattern is `__builtin_<builtin_type>_<index_or_key>` (e.g., `__builtin_git_check_0`)
3. **Policy Embedding:** Init command embeds policy content as string literals in main.rs
4. **Routing Requirements:** Builtins use `# METADATA` with `required_events` and optional `required_tools`
5. **Decision Verbs:** Use `halt` for immediate blocking, `deny` for normal blocking
6. **Input Access:** Policies access Claude Code events via `input.hook_event_name`, `input.tool_name`, `input.params`/`input.tool_input`

## Security Patterns Addressed

### Direct File Operations (Immediate Block) ✅
- [x] Edit tool targeting .cupcake/ files
- [x] Write tool targeting .cupcake/ files  
- [x] MultiEdit tool targeting .cupcake/ files
- [x] NotebookEdit tool targeting .cupcake/ files

### Bash Command Patterns (Pattern Detection) ✅
- [x] Direct deletion: `rm`, `rmdir`
- [x] File moves: `mv`
- [x] File copies: `cp` (could overwrite)
- [x] Redirection: `>`, `>>`
- [x] In-place editing: `sed -i`, `perl -i`
- [x] Archive operations: `tar`, `zip`
- [x] Permission changes: `chmod`, `chown`
- [x] Script execution with .cupcake paths (python, ruby, node, etc.)
- [x] Command substitution detection: `$(`, `${`, backticks
- [x] Find with delete/exec: `find.*-delete`, `find.*-exec`
- [x] Data operations: `dd`, `rsync`, `truncate`, `touch`

### Path Obfuscation Resistance ✅
- [x] Relative path normalization (./././.cupcake/) via regex matching
- [x] Path cleaning (multiple slashes, /./ segments)
- [x] Direct .cupcake reference detection
- [x] Absolute path ending detection (/.cupcake)

### Advanced Threat Coverage ✅
- [x] Script injection via python/ruby/node with .cupcake paths
- [x] Command substitution obfuscation: `$(echo ".cupcake")`
- [x] Variable expansion patterns: `${VAR}`, `env`, `printenv`
- [x] Dynamic evaluation: `eval` commands
- [x] Archive-based attacks: tar/zip manipulation

## Testing Checklist ✅

- [x] Unit tests for policy logic (OPA tests with 4/4 PASS)
- [x] Integration tests with engine (comprehensive rulebook_security_integration.rs)
- [x] Init command verification (creates all 5 builtins including new policy)
- [x] Security pattern coverage tests (25+ dangerous bash patterns, all file tools)
- [x] Edge case testing (path obfuscation, command substitution, script injection)
- [x] Performance impact assessment (minimal - simple pattern matching, 1s signal timeout)

## Final Security Assessment

### Threat Model Coverage: **COMPREHENSIVE** ✅
- **File Operation Blocking:** 100% coverage of Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit tools
- **Command Injection Prevention:** 25+ dangerous bash patterns covered
- **Path Obfuscation Resistance:** Multi-layer detection (regex, normalization, absolute paths)
- **Advanced Attack Vectors:** Script injection, command substitution, variable expansion

### Defense in Depth
1. **Policy Level:** Rego rules with pattern matching and path analysis
2. **Configuration Level:** Customizable messages and protected paths via signals
3. **Engine Level:** Integration with builtin system and routing
4. **Init Level:** Automatic deployment with cupcake init

### Known Limitations & Future Enhancements
1. **Script Content Inspection:** Not implemented - would require parsing script files
2. **Symlink Resolution:** Basic protection only - advanced symlink attacks possible
3. **Environment Variable Expansion:** Pattern detection only - runtime expansion not resolved
4. **Trust System Integration:** Policy integrity verification not yet implemented

### Recommendation: **PRODUCTION READY** ✅
The rulebook_security_guardrails builtin provides robust protection against:
- Direct file manipulation of Cupcake configuration
- Command injection targeting .cupcake/ directory  
- Path obfuscation and evasion techniques
- Script-based attacks via multiple interpreters

The implementation follows Cupcake's established patterns, integrates seamlessly with the existing builtin system, and provides comprehensive test coverage.
