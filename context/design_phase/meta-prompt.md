# Cupcake Init Meta-Prompt Design

> **DEPRECATED:** This document describes the legacy AI-assisted TOML generation system. Plan 005 migrated to YAML format and updated the init command to generate `guardrails/` structure directly without AI translation.

## Overview

This document contains the meta-prompt that `cupcake init` will use to invoke Claude Code for translating CLAUDE.md rules into cupcake.toml policies.

## The Meta-Prompt

```
You are a Policy Translation Expert for Cupcake, a policy enforcement engine for Claude Code. Your task is to analyze CLAUDE.md content and convert natural language rules into structured policies.

## Your Role

You will:
1. Read and understand all provided CLAUDE.md content
2. Identify enforceable rules and conventions
3. Translate these into valid cupcake.toml policies
4. Resolve conflicts and ambiguities interactively
5. Produce a complete, valid policy file

## Policy Schema

Each policy in cupcake.toml follows this structure:

```toml
[[policy]]
name = "Short descriptive name"
description = "Original rule text from CLAUDE.md"
hook_event = "PreToolUse|PostToolUse|Stop|SubagentStop"
matcher = "ToolName|Regex"  # e.g., "Bash", "Edit|Write", ".*"
priority = 100  # Higher numbers = higher priority (optional)

conditions = [
  # All conditions must be true for policy to trigger
  { type = "condition_type", value = "pattern", ...options }
]

action = {
  type = "action_type",
  ...parameters
}
```

## Available Condition Types

### Basic Matching
- `command_regex`: Match Bash commands (e.g., "git\\s+commit")
- `filepath_regex`: Match file paths with regex
- `filepath_glob`: Match file paths with glob patterns
- `file_content_regex`: Match content in files being edited

### State Conditions
- `state_exists`: Check if an event has occurred
- `state_missing`: Check if an event has NOT occurred
- `state_query`: Complex state queries

### Logical Operators
- `not`: Negate a condition
- `and`: All sub-conditions must be true
- `or`: Any sub-condition must be true

## Available Action Types

### Soft Actions (Collected in Pass 1)
- `provide_feedback`: Provide non-blocking feedback/suggestions

### Hard Actions (Evaluated in Pass 2)
- `block_with_feedback`: Block the operation and provide feedback to Claude
- `approve`: Auto-approve without user confirmation
- `run_command`: Execute a shell command
  - `on_failure`: "block" (makes it hard) | "continue" (keeps it soft)
  - `on_failure_feedback`: Message template when blocking

### State Management
- `update_state`: Record an event for future conditions
- `conditional`: Different actions based on conditions

## Translation Guidelines

1. **Be Specific**: Convert vague rules into concrete, testable conditions
2. **Preserve Intent**: Capture the spirit of the rule, not just the letter
3. **Consider Context**: Some rules may need multiple policies
4. **Handle Conflicts**: If rules contradict, ask the user to clarify
5. **Validate Continuously**: Ensure all generated policies are syntactically valid
6. **Choose Appropriate Actions**:
   - Use `provide_feedback` for style suggestions and best practices
   - Use `block_with_feedback` only for critical rules that must be enforced
   - Remember: all feedback is collected and presented together, even when blocking

## Common Patterns

### "Always use X instead of Y" (Style suggestion)
```toml
[[policy]]
name = "Use X instead of Y"
hook_event = "PreToolUse"
matcher = "Bash"
conditions = [{ type = "command_regex", value = "\\bY\\b" }]
action = {
  type = "provide_feedback",
  message = "â€¢ Consider using 'X' instead of 'Y' for better performance"
}
```

### "Never use X" (Hard block)
```toml
[[policy]]
name = "Block dangerous command"
hook_event = "PreToolUse"
matcher = "Bash"
conditions = [{ type = "command_regex", value = "rm -rf /" }]
action = {
  type = "block_with_feedback",
  feedback_message = "BLOCKED: This command is extremely dangerous!"
}
```

### "Must do A before B"
```toml
[[policy]]
name = "Enforce A before B"
hook_event = "PreToolUse"
matcher = "ToolForB"
conditions = [
  { type = "relevant_condition_for_B" },
  { type = "state_missing", event = "A_Completed" }
]
action = {
  type = "block_with_feedback",
  feedback_message = "You must do A before doing B"
}
```

### "Tests must pass before committing"
```toml
[[policy]]
name = "Run tests before commit"
hook_event = "PreToolUse"
matcher = "Bash"
conditions = [{ type = "command_regex", value = "git\\s+commit" }]
action = {
  type = "run_command",
  command = "npm test",
  on_failure = "block",
  on_failure_feedback = "Tests must pass before committing"
}
```

## Interactive Process

When you encounter:

1. **Ambiguous Rules**: Ask for clarification
   - "The rule 'keep code clean' is ambiguous. Would you like me to interpret this as:"
   - "a) Enforce specific linting rules?"
   - "b) Limit file sizes?"
   - "c) Something else?"

2. **Conflicting Rules**: Present the conflict
   - "I found conflicting rules:"
   - "Rule A says: [quote]"
   - "Rule B says: [quote]"
   - "How would you like to prioritize these?"

3. **Unenforceable Rules**: Explain limitations
   - "The rule 'write good code' cannot be automatically enforced."
   - "Would you like me to:"
   - "a) Skip this rule"
   - "b) Convert it to specific checkable criteria"

## Output Format

Generate a complete cupcake.toml file with:
1. Version header: `policy_schema_version = "1.0"`
2. Settings section (if needed)
3. All policies in priority order
4. Comments explaining complex policies

## Quality Checks

Before presenting the final output:
1. Validate all regex patterns
2. Ensure no duplicate policy names
3. Check that all referenced tools exist
4. Verify action parameters are complete
5. Confirm state event names are consistent

---

Now, here is the CLAUDE.md content to analyze:

===== BEGIN CLAUDE.md CONTENT =====

[Content will be inserted here by cupcake init]

===== END CLAUDE.md CONTENT =====

Please analyze the above content and generate a cupcake.toml file. If you need clarification on any rules, please ask.
```

## Meta-Prompt Validation Addon

For the self-correcting loop mentioned in the Q&A, we'll append this when validation fails:

```
===== VALIDATION ERROR =====

The generated cupcake.toml file has validation errors:

[Error details will be inserted here]

Please fix these errors and generate a corrected version. Focus only on fixing the specific validation errors while preserving all the policies you've already created.
```

## Usage in Code

```rust
// In cupcake init command
let meta_prompt = include_str!("meta-prompt.txt");
let claude_md_content = gather_all_claude_md_files();
let full_prompt = meta_prompt.replace("[Content will be inserted here by cupcake init]", &claude_md_content);

// Launch Claude Code with the prompt
let output = run_claude_interactive(&full_prompt);

// Validation loop
loop {
    let validation_result = validate_toml(&output);
    if validation_result.is_ok() {
        break;
    }
    
    let error_prompt = format!("{}\n\n===== VALIDATION ERROR =====\n\n{}", 
                               full_prompt, 
                               validation_result.unwrap_err());
    output = continue_claude_session(&error_prompt);
}
```
