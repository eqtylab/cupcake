Design Refinements

The existing design is solid. Here are some
refinements for elegance and capability:

1. Policy Format Enhancement: Add a version
   field to cupcake.toml for future
   compatibility
2. Caching Strategy: Consider caching parsed
   policies in memory-mapped files for faster
   startup
3. Testing Framework: Include a cupcake test
   command to dry-run policies against sample
   inputs
4. Audit Trail: Optional logging of all
   policy decisions for compliance/debugging
