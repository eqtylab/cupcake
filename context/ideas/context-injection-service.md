# Context Injection Service - Intelligent Prompt Augmentation

Created: 2025-01-25T12:05:00Z
Type: Feature Idea

## Concept

A smart service that analyzes user prompts in real-time and automatically compiles relevant context to inject into Claude's awareness, making Claude more effective without requiring users to provide extensive context.

## The Vision

When a user types "fix the test failures", the service would:

1. **Analyze the prompt** - Detect keywords like "fix", "test", "failures"
2. **Query project state** - Check recent test runs, identify failing tests
3. **Gather relevant context** - Pull error messages, stack traces, recent changes
4. **Compile smart context** - Create concise, relevant injection
5. **Inject seamlessly** - Add to Claude's context before processing

## Example Flow

**User prompt**: "help me debug this issue"

**Service analyzes and injects**:
```
RECENT ERRORS:
- TypeError in user_auth.test.ts line 42
- Database connection timeout in integration tests
- 3 linting errors in src/api/routes.ts

RECENT CHANGES:
- Modified database config 2 commits ago
- Updated auth middleware yesterday

PROJECT STATE:
- Build: FAILING (since commit a3f2b)
- Tests: 18/23 passing
- Coverage: 73% (down from 81%)
```

## Implementation Ideas

### 1. Prompt Analysis Engine
- NLP to understand intent
- Keyword extraction
- Context relevance scoring

### 2. Context Sources
- Git history (recent commits, changes)
- Test results (failures, coverage)
- Build logs (errors, warnings)
- Session history (recent violations)
- Project metadata (tech stack, conventions)
- Error tracking (recent exceptions)

### 3. Smart Compilation
- Relevance filtering (only inject what matters)
- Conciseness optimization (minimal tokens)
- Priority ordering (most relevant first)
- Dynamic templates based on prompt type

### 4. Learning System
- Track which context leads to successful resolutions
- Learn user patterns
- Improve relevance over time

## Potential Features

### Contextual Awareness
- "Working on auth" → Inject auth-related docs, tests, recent auth changes
- "Performance issue" → Inject profiling data, slow query logs, metrics
- "Refactor this" → Inject code quality reports, similar patterns in codebase

### Proactive Suggestions
- Detect when user might need context they didn't ask for
- Inject warnings about related systems
- Add reminders about team conventions

### Multi-Source Integration
- Pull from external tools (Jira, Sentry, DataDog)
- Integrate with CI/CD for build context
- Connect to documentation systems

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Cognitive Load** - User doesn't need to remember/provide context
2. **Faster Resolution** - Claude has info immediately
3. **Better First Attempts** - Less back-and-forth
4. **Knowledge Capture** - System learns what context matters

## Challenges

1. **Performance** - Must be fast to not slow down prompts
2. **Relevance** - Too much context is worse than none
3. **Privacy** - Careful what gets injected
4. **Complexity** - Could become over-engineered

## MVP Scope

Start simple:
1. Basic keyword matching
2. Pull from 3-4 sources (git, tests, recent errors)
3. Static templates
4. Measure effectiveness

## Future Possibilities

- AI-powered context relevance scoring
- User-specific context preferences
- Team knowledge sharing through context
- Context marketplace (shared templates)

## Integration with Cupcake

This service would:
1. Use Cupcake's state management for session awareness
2. Leverage UserPromptSubmit hook for injection
3. Build on Cupcake's policy system for rules
4. Extend Cupcake from enforcer to intelligent assistant

## Conclusion

This service would make Claude Code feel "psychic" - always knowing the right context without being told. It's the natural evolution of context injection from static rules to dynamic intelligence.
