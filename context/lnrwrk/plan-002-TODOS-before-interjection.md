# Plan 002: TODOs Before Architecture Interjection

Created: 2025-01-11T12:05:00Z
Status: Snapshot before pivot

## Completed Tasks

### PHASE 1: Foundation (All Completed)
- ‚úÖ Implement stdin JSON parsing for hook events
- ‚úÖ Create policy loading infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Build basic response framework (exit codes)
- ‚úÖ Add comprehensive error handling
- ‚úÖ Write unit tests for hook event deserialization
- ‚úÖ Create integration test for basic run command

### PHASE 2: Conditions (All Completed)
- ‚úÖ Implement basic condition matchers (regex/glob)
- ‚úÖ Add logical operators (And/Or/Not)
- ‚úÖ Implement file system conditions
- ‚úÖ Add time-based conditions
- ‚úÖ Write comprehensive condition evaluation tests

### PHASE 3: State Management (All Completed)
- ‚úÖ Create state file structure and management
- ‚úÖ Implement automatic tool usage tracking
- ‚úÖ Build state query engine
- ‚úÖ Write state management tests

### PHASE 4: Two-Pass Evaluation (All Completed)
- ‚úÖ Implement Pass 1 feedback collection
- ‚úÖ Implement Pass 2 hard action detection
- ‚úÖ Build result aggregation logic
- ‚úÖ Write two-pass evaluation tests

### PHASE 5: Actions (All Completed)
- ‚úÖ Implement basic actions (feedback/block/approve)
- ‚úÖ Add command execution with process spawning
- ‚úÖ Implement template variable substitution
- ‚úÖ Add state modification actions
- ‚úÖ Implement conditional actions
- ‚úÖ Write action execution tests

### Investigation Tasks (All Completed)
- ‚úÖ INVESTIGATE: Action type duplication between config and engine modules
- ‚úÖ INVESTIGATE: Template system consolidation strategy
- ‚úÖ INVESTIGATE: State query conversion placeholder implementation
- ‚úÖ INVESTIGATE: Module structure refactoring feasibility
- ‚úÖ INVESTIGATE: Test organization and potential extraction

## Pending Tasks (Before Interjection)

### PHASE 6: Integration
- ‚è≥ Integrate all components into PolicyEngine
- ‚è≥ Add comprehensive error handling
- ‚è≥ Implement debug mode and audit logging
- ‚è≥ Performance optimization and benchmarking
- ‚è≥ End-to-end integration testing

### Critical Fixes Identified
- ‚è≥ FIX: Complete condition conversion in evaluation.rs (supports only 4/14 types)
- ‚è≥ FIX: Integrate StateManager with PolicyEvaluator for state tracking
- ‚è≥ FIX: Remove duplicate template substitution in evaluation.rs
- ‚è≥ DOCUMENT: Explain config vs engine Action enum separation

### New Critical Task
- üö® CRITICAL: Architecture pivot to 3-primitive condition model

## Summary

Phases 1-5 are complete with 25 tasks done. During investigation, we discovered fundamental architecture issues:

1. **Condition System**: 15 hardcoded types when 3 generic ones would suffice
2. **Converter Issues**: Only 4/15 types properly converted
3. **State Integration**: StateManager created but not integrated
4. **Design Misalignment**: Implementation doesn't match elegant design intent

This snapshot captures the state before the critical architecture pivot decision.
