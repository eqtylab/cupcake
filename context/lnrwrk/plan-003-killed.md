# Plan 003 Killed

Killed: 2025-01-21T10:00:00Z

## Reason

Plan 003 was originally conceived to implement the user lifecycle commands (init, sync, validate) with the following assumptions:
1. TOML-based policy format (cupcake.toml)
2. Spawning external `claude` process for AI translation
3. Complex memory discovery with @import resolution

## What Changed

Since this plan was created:
1. Policy format evolved from TOML to YAML (Plan 005)
2. CLI commands were implemented incrementally through other plans
3. The init experience needs fundamental rethinking for better UX

## Current State

The following commands exist but need refinement:
- `validate` - Implemented and working with YAML format
- `sync` - Basic implementation exists
- `init` - Needs complete redesign for better user experience

## Superseded By

A new plan will be created to design and implement a proper init experience with:
- Modern CLI/TUI patterns for multi-stage workflows
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Clear user choices and feedback
- Integration with current YAML-based system

## Lessons Learned

- User experience design should precede implementation
- Multi-stage workflows benefit from TUI elements
- Policy format migration made original design obsolete
