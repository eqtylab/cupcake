Depends: plan-003
Enables: none

## Goal

Finalize the MVP by implementing critical non-functional requirements, focusing on performance, observability, and reliability to ensure the tool is robust and ready for distribution.

## Success Criteria

- The policy caching system using `bincode` is implemented and integrated, fulfilling the sub-100ms performance requirement for the `run` command.
- The optional audit logging system is fully functional, allowing users to enable a structured audit trail of all policy decisions via `cupcake.toml`.
- A comprehensive test suite exists, providing strong coverage for all components through unit, integration, and end-to-end tests that simulate real hook invocations.
- All user-facing documentation, including the main README and detailed CLI help text for every command and argument, is complete and polished.
