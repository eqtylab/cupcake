# plan 005 Completed

Completed: 2025-07-12T11:25:00Z

## Delivered

- Complete migration from TOML to YAML policy format
- New `guardrails/` directory structure with composable policy fragments
- Root `guardrails/cupcake.yaml` configuration with settings and imports
- Policy fragment files under `guardrails/policies/*.yaml` with "Grouped Map" format
- Deep merge composition logic for combining policy fragments
- Unique name validation across all composed policies
- Binary caching maintained for sub-100ms performance
- Full test suite migrated to YAML format with 100% pass rate
- All documentation updated with YAML examples

## Key Files

- src/config/loader.rs - New YAML composition engine
- src/config/types.rs - RootConfig, YamlPolicy, PolicyFragment, ComposedPolicy types
- src/cli/commands/init.rs - Generates guardrails/ structure
- src/cli/commands/run.rs - Uses new loader with auto-discovery
- src/cli/commands/validate.rs - Validates composed YAML policies
- guardrails/cupcake.yaml - Root configuration example
- guardrails/policies/00-base.yaml - Example policy fragments

## Unlocks

- Teams can now organize policies by domain (security, git, frontend, etc.)
- Multiple teams can contribute policies without merge conflicts
- Policy fragments can be version controlled independently
- Clear ownership model for different policy domains
- Foundation for future policy marketplace/sharing

## Notes

Migration executed in 6 phases over 2 days. All phases completed successfully:
1. Dependencies & Error Handling - Replaced toml with serde_yaml_ng
2. Core Type System Refactor - New YAML-oriented types
3. Policy Loader Implementation - Three-step composition engine
4. Engine & CLI Integration - Connected new loader throughout
5. Test Infrastructure Migration - All tests converted to YAML
6. Documentation & Cleanup - Removed deprecated code, updated all docs

Minor cleanup remaining: src/io/paths.rs still has dead code referencing cupcake.toml.
This doesn't affect functionality as the new loader doesn't use these methods.

Performance target maintained - sub-100ms response time preserved through:
- Binary policy caching (unchanged)
- Compiled regex caching (unchanged)
- Efficient HashMap-based composition
- Alphabetical file loading for determinism

The "Grouped Map" YAML structure successfully balances:
- Human readability and editability
- Machine parseability and composition
- Scalability to hundreds of policies
- Clear organization by hook event and tool matcher
