 Let me verify
  the key alignment points:

  Hook Events Alignment ✅

  Claude Code Hooks:
  - PreToolUse
  - PostToolUse
  - Notification
  - Stop
  - SubagentStop
  - PreCompact

  Cupcake Implementation:
  // From src/config/types.rs
  pub enum HookEventType {
      PreToolUse,
      PostToolUse,
      Notification,
      Stop,
      SubagentStop,
      PreCompact,
  }

  Perfect match!

  Hook Input/Output Alignment ✅

  Claude Code: JSON via stdin with session_id, transcript_path, hook_event_name, and
  event-specific fields

  Cupcake:
  // From src/engine/events.rs
  pub enum HookEvent {
      PreToolUse {
          common: CommonEventData,  // session_id, transcript_path
          tool_name: String,
          tool_input: serde_json::Value,
      },
      // ... matches all Claude Code events
  }

  Exit Code Behavior Alignment ✅

  Claude Code:
  - Exit 0: Success (stdout to transcript mode)
  - Exit 2: Blocking error (stderr to Claude)
  - Other: Non-blocking error

  Cupcake:
  // From src/cli/commands/run.rs
  PolicyDecision::Allow => std::process::exit(0);
  PolicyDecision::Block { feedback } => {
      eprintln!("{}", feedback);  // stderr
      std::process::exit(2);
  }

  Tool Matcher Alignment ✅

  Claude Code:
  - Simple strings: "Write"
  - Regex support: "Edit|Write"
  - Empty/omitted for all tools

  Cupcake:
  - Exact same format in YAML policies
  - "Bash", "Edit|Write", "*" all supported

  Key Differences (By Design)

  1. Configuration Format:
    - Claude Code: Direct shell commands in JSON
    - Cupcake: YAML policies with conditions and actions
  2. Purpose:
    - Claude Code: Execute arbitrary shell commands
    - Cupcake: Declarative policy enforcement
  3. Integration:
    - Cupcake generates the hooks configuration that Claude Code expects
    - cupcake sync writes to .claude/settings.json

  Summary

  Cupcake is perfectly aligned with Claude Code's hook system. It acts as a higher-level
  abstraction that:
  1. Reads the same hook events
  2. Uses the same exit codes
  3. Follows the same stdin/stdout/stderr conventions
  4. Generates compatible .claude/settings.json configurations

  The main value-add is transforming declarative YAML policies into the lower-level hook
  commands that Claude Code executes, making policy management more scalable and
  maintainable.

> But cupcake can certainly provide extended behavior by executing shell commands, correct?

⏺ Absolutely correct! Cupcake has the run_command action type that executes shell commands,
   providing the same extended behavior capabilities as raw Claude Code hooks.

  Shell Command Execution in Cupcake

  From our implementation:

  # Policy with shell command execution
  PreToolUse:
    "Bash":
      - name: "Run tests before git push"
        conditions:
          - type: "pattern"
            field: "tool_input.command"
            regex: "^git\\s+push"
        action:
          type: "run_command"
          command: "npm test"
          on_failure: "block"  # or "continue"
          on_failure_feedback: "Tests must pass before pushing"
          timeout_seconds: 30

  Full Capabilities

  Looking at src/config/actions.rs:

  RunCommand {
      command: String,
      on_failure: OnFailureBehavior,
      on_failure_feedback: Option<String>,
      background: bool,
      timeout_seconds: Option<u32>,
  }

  This allows:
  - Execute any shell command - Just like raw hooks
  - Control flow based on exit codes - Block or continue
  - Background execution - For non-blocking operations
  - Custom timeouts - Override the default 60s
  - Template variables - Commands can use {{tool_input.file_path}} etc.

  Examples of Extended Behavior

  # Auto-format code after edits
  PostToolUse:
    "Edit|Write":
      - name: "Auto-format Python files"
        conditions:
          - type: "pattern"
            field: "tool_input.file_path"
            regex: "\\.py$"
        action:
          type: "run_command"
          command: "black {{tool_input.file_path}}"
          on_failure: "continue"

  # Custom validation scripts
  PreToolUse:
    "Write":
      - name: "Validate config files"
        conditions:
          - type: "pattern"
            field: "tool_input.file_path"
            regex: "config/.*\\.yaml$"
        action:
          type: "run_command"
          command: "/home/user/scripts/validate-config.py {{tool_input.file_path}}"
          on_failure: "block"
          on_failure_feedback: "Config validation failed"

  # Logging and metrics
  PostToolUse:
    "*":  # All tools
      - name: "Log tool usage"
        conditions: []
        action:
          type: "run_command"
          command: "echo '{{timestamp}} {{tool_name}} {{session_id}}' >>
  ~/.cupcake/usage.log"
          background: true

  So yes, Cupcake provides all the power of shell command execution that raw Claude Code
  hooks offer, but with:
  1. Better organization - Policies grouped by purpose
  2. Conditional execution - Only run commands when conditions match
  3. Declarative format - Easier to read and maintain
  4. Safety features - Template escaping, structured feedback

  You get the full flexibility of shell commands plus the benefits of a policy management
  system!
