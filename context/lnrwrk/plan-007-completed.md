# Plan 007 Completed

Completed: 2025-07-13T16:50:00Z

## Delivered

**Complete Action Execution Integration** - Connected the fully-implemented but orphaned ActionExecutor to the runtime flow, enabling UpdateState persistence and actual command execution.

### Key Deliverables

1. **Connected ActionExecutor to Runtime**:
   - Added ActionExecutor instantiation in run command
   - Created action execution phase after policy evaluation
   - Actions now execute for all matched policies

2. **State Persistence Working**:
   - UpdateState actions now persist to `.cupcake/state/<session_id>.json`
   - State manager reference passed to action executor
   - Custom events properly saved with timestamps

3. **Command Execution Fixed**:
   - RunCommand actions execute real commands instead of placeholders
   - Command success/failure properly handled
   - Action results can override evaluation decisions

4. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Created `tests/action_execution_integration_test.rs`
   - Tests verify UpdateState persistence
   - Tests verify RunCommand execution (success and failure)
   - All 3 integration tests passing

## Key Files Modified

- `src/engine/actions.rs` - Updated execute() to accept StateManager reference
- `src/engine/evaluation.rs` - Added matched_policies tracking to EvaluationResult
- `src/cli/commands/run.rs` - Integrated ActionExecutor and action execution phase
- `tests/action_execution_integration_test.rs` - New comprehensive integration tests

## Technical Decisions

- **StateManager Reference**: Passed as parameter rather than stored in ActionExecutor to avoid lifetime complexity
- **Two-Phase Execution**: Maintained separation between evaluation (decision) and execution (actions)
- **Action Override**: Action execution results can override evaluation decisions (e.g., RunCommand failures)
- **Deferred Command Execution**: RunCommand actions don't block during evaluation, only after execution

## Verification

```bash
# All tests pass
cargo test --test action_execution_integration_test

# Manual verification
echo '{"hook_event_name": "PostToolUse", "session_id": "test", "tool_name": "Read", "tool_input": {"file_path": "/tmp/test.txt"}}' | cargo run -- run --event PostToolUse --debug

# Check state file created
cat .cupcake/state/test.json
```

## Summary

Plan 007 successfully closed the ~15% implementation gap in Plan 002. The critical architectural disconnect between PolicyEvaluator and ActionExecutor has been resolved. The system now fully implements the design vision:

- Policies are evaluated to find matches
- Actions are executed for matched policies
- State updates persist for complex workflows
- Commands execute with proper success/failure handling

This completes the core runtime engine functionality. The system is now ready for Plans 003 (User Lifecycle) and 004 (Hardening).
