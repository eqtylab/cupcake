# Progress Log for Plan 008

## 2025-07-14T14:30:00Z

**Phase 1: Configuration Structs - COMPLETED**

Started implementation of Plan 008 Part 1 (Secure Array Executor) with focus on elegant, industry-standard solution.

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Designed CommandSpec Architecture**:
   - Created `CommandSpec` enum with `Array(ArrayCommandSpec)` variant
   - Designed `ArrayCommandSpec` with Kubernetes-compatible fields
   - Added 7 composition operators: `pipe`, `redirectStdout`, `appendStdout`, `redirectStderr`, `mergeStderr`, `onSuccess`, `onFailure`
   - Added `EnvVar` and `PipeCommand` supporting structures

2. **Updated Action and Condition Types**:
   - Modified `Action::RunCommand` to use `CommandSpec` instead of `String`
   - Updated `Condition::Check` to use secure `CommandSpec`
   - Maintained backward compatibility with temporary conversion function

3. **Created Comprehensive Test Suite**:
   - Built `tests/command_spec_config_test.rs` with thorough validation
   - Tests cover: basic structures, YAML serialization, composition operators, edge cases
   - Validates security: template variables preserved for safe substitution
   - Tests complex command composition with multiple operators

### Key Design Decisions:

1. **Security-First Design**:
   - Command path in array format prevents injection
   - Template substitution only in args/env, never command path
   - Composition operators replace shell metacharacters

2. **Kubernetes Compatibility**:
   - Used identical field names to K8s Pod specs (`command`, `args`, `workingDir`, `env`)
   - Added cupcake-specific operators with clear shell analogues
   - Maintained familiar YAML structure for developer adoption

3. **Elegant Type System**:
   - Tagged unions with serde for clean serialization
   - Optional fields to minimize YAML verbosity
   - Nested structures for complex compositions

### Technical Implementation:
- Added temporary `convert_spec_to_legacy_string()` to maintain compilation
- Updated all configuration structs in `src/config/actions.rs` and `src/config/conditions.rs`
- Created comprehensive test coverage for all scenarios

### Next Steps (Phase 2):
- Create `CommandGraph` internal representation
- Implement `CommandExecutor` module with direct process spawning
- Build secure pipe/redirect handling with tokio

**Critical Security Fix Applied - COMPLETED**

Fixed template substitution vulnerability discovered during opus review.

### Vulnerability Details:
- **Issue**: Template substitution was being applied to command paths (line 175)
- **Risk**: Allowed command injection through template variables like `{{cmd}}`
- **Violation**: Requirement #7 of Plan 008 - templates only in args/env

### Fix Implementation:
1. **Secure Code Change**:
   ```rust
   // Before (VULNERABLE):
   let program = self.substitute_template(&spec.command[0])?;
   
   // After (SECURE):
   let program = spec.command[0].clone();
   if program.contains("{{") || program.contains("}}") {
       return Err(ExecutionError::InvalidSpec(
           "Template variables are not allowed in command paths for security reasons".to_string()
       ));
   }
   ```

2. **Comprehensive Security Test Added**:
   - `test_command_path_template_injection_blocked()` validates fix
   - Tests full templates in command paths are rejected
   - Tests partial templates in command paths are rejected  
   - Confirms templates in args still work correctly

3. **All Tests Pass**: ✅
   - 7 command executor tests passing
   - Security test confirms vulnerability is blocked
   - No regressions in existing functionality

### Final Security Status:
- **Template injection in command paths**: ❌ BLOCKED
- **Shell injection**: ❌ ELIMINATED  
- **Command injection**: ❌ PREVENTED
- **Safe template substitution**: ✅ Args and env only

The implementation now **fully meets** all security requirements of Plan 008.
