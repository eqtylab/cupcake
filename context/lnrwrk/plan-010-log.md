# Progress Log for Plan 010

## 2025-07-16T18:15:00Z

Started Plan 010: Optimize Policy Evaluation Performance
- Created feature branch `feat/optimize-eval`
- Problem identified: Triple evaluation of policies (O(3n) instead of O(n))
- Approach: TDD using debug logging to count evaluations
- Goal: Eliminate redundant policy evaluations while maintaining semantics

**OPTIMIZATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** ✅

### Implementation Results
- **Test-driven approach**: Created failing test that counted policy evaluations via debug logs
- **Confirmed issue**: Test showed 6 evaluations instead of 2 (3x redundant evaluations)
- **Root cause identified**: PolicyEvaluator was evaluating policies 3 separate times:
  1. Initial matched policy collection (lines 65-76)
  2. Pass 1: Soft feedback collection (execute_pass_1)  
  3. Pass 2: Hard action detection (execute_pass_2)

### Optimization Strategy
- **Single evaluation + caching**: Evaluate each policy exactly once, cache results
- **HashMap cache**: Store evaluation results by policy name
- **Cached methods**: Created `execute_pass_1_cached` and `execute_pass_2_cached`
- **Maintained semantics**: Same evaluation logic, just cached results

### Performance Impact
- **Before**: 6 evaluations for 2 policies (3x per policy)
- **After**: 2 evaluations for 2 policies (1x per policy)  
- **Improvement**: 3x reduction in policy evaluation overhead
- **Test verification**: All 268 tests pass, including new efficiency test

### Files Modified
- `src/engine/evaluation.rs`: Added caching optimization
- `tests/policy_evaluation_efficiency_test.rs`: TDD test for counting evaluations

### Success Metrics Achieved
✅ Eliminated triple evaluation inefficiency  
✅ Maintained exact same evaluation semantics  
✅ All existing tests continue to pass  
✅ Clear, measurable performance improvement  
✅ Elegant, maintainable solution
