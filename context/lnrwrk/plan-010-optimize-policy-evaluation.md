# Plan 010: Optimize Policy Evaluation Performance

Created: 2025-01-14T10:10:00Z
Depends: plan-007
Enables: plan-014
Priority: IMPORTANT

## Goal

Eliminate the inefficient triple evaluation of policies by caching evaluation results from the first pass and reusing them in subsequent passes.

## Success Criteria

- Policies evaluated only once per hook event
- 3x performance improvement for policy evaluation
- No change in evaluation semantics or results
- Benchmark tests demonstrate performance gains
- Code is cleaner and more maintainable

## Context

Plan 007's implementation evaluates policies three times:
1. To collect matched policies
2. For Pass 1 (soft feedback collection)
3. For Pass 2 (hard decision finding)

Each evaluation includes policy filtering, condition evaluation, and regex compilation. This creates unnecessary overhead that scales poorly with large policy sets.

## Performance Impact

- **Current**: O(3n) evaluations where n = number of policies
- **Target**: O(n) evaluations with cached results
- **Expected Speedup**: ~3x for policy evaluation phase
- **Affected Component**: `PolicyEvaluator` in `src/engine/evaluation.rs`
