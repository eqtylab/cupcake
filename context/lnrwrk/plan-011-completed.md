# Plan 011 Completed

Completed: 2025-01-16T14:30:00Z

## Delivered

- Removed unnecessary CLI timeout argument from all code paths
- Fixed hardcoded command execution timeout to use configurable settings
- Created LoadedConfiguration struct to properly pass settings alongside policies
- Updated ActionExecutor to accept and use settings for timeout defaults
- All tests updated and passing (141 unit tests, 19 integration tests)

## Key Files Modified

- `src/cli/app.rs` - Removed timeout argument from RunCommand
- `src/cli/commands/run.rs` - Removed timeout field, updated to use LoadedConfiguration
- `src/config/loader.rs` - Added LoadedConfiguration struct
- `src/engine/actions.rs` - Fixed hardcoded timeout to use settings.timeout_ms

## Technical Notes

1. **Timeout Hierarchy Clarified**:
   - Claude Code enforces external hook timeout (60s default)
   - Cupcake only needs to control timeouts for commands it executes
   - Settings provide global default (timeout_ms)
   - Individual actions can override with timeout_seconds

2. **Configuration Flow Improved**:
   - LoadedConfiguration bundles settings with policies
   - Settings properly flow through to ActionExecutor
   - No more scattered timeout logic

## Unlocks

- Cleaner timeout configuration for future enhancements
- Simplified CLI interface without confusing timeout parameter
- Foundation for Plan 002/003/004 timeout-related features

## Branch

Created and implemented on `feat/refine-timeouts` branch
