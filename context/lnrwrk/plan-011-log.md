# Progress Log for Plan 011

## 2025-01-16T12:00:00Z

Started Plan 011 to refine timeout configuration after analyzing the code inventory.
Key findings:
- CLI timeout in app.rs serves no purpose since Claude Code enforces timeouts externally
- Hardcoded timeout in actions.rs should use settings.timeout_ms instead
- Need to pass settings through the execution flow

## 2025-01-16T12:30:00Z

Removed CLI timeout argument from app.rs:
- Removed `--timeout` argument from RunCommand definition
- Updated run command creation to not pass timeout

## 2025-01-16T13:00:00Z

Fixed timeout configuration flow:
- Removed timeout field from RunCommand struct
- Updated RunCommand::new() signature
- Created LoadedConfiguration struct to pass both settings and policies together
- Modified ActionExecutor to accept settings in constructor

## 2025-01-16T13:30:00Z

Updated action execution to use settings:
- Changed hardcoded timeout_seconds.unwrap_or(30) to use settings.timeout_ms
- Passed settings to ActionExecutor through with_settings() method
- Updated run command to load configuration instead of just policies

## 2025-01-16T14:00:00Z

Fixed all test failures:
- Updated CLI integration tests to remove timeout references
- Fixed run command tests removing load_policies() in favor of load_configuration()
- Added Debug trait to LoadedConfiguration
- Fixed unused variable warnings with underscore prefixes

## 2025-01-16T14:30:00Z

Verified implementation:
- All 141 unit tests pass
- All 19 CLI integration tests pass
- Timeout configuration now properly flows from settings to command execution
- No more hardcoded timeouts in the codebase
