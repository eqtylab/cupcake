# Plan 016 Completed

Completed: 2025-07-18T18:00:00Z

## Delivered

Full support for Claude Code's latest hook updates, including the new UserPromptSubmit event and enhanced hook data:

### Core Features Implemented
- **UserPromptSubmit hook event** - Intercept and validate user prompts before Claude processes them
- **cwd field** - Added to all hook events as authoritative working directory
- **Empty string matcher** - Convention for non-tool events (UserPromptSubmit, Notification, etc.)
- **Enhanced response handling** - Exit code 2 blocks prompts with stderr feedback

### Technical Implementation
- Updated HookEvent enum with UserPromptSubmit variant
- Added prompt field to EvaluationContext for condition matching
- Enhanced policy loader to handle empty string matchers correctly
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality

## Key Files

- src/engine/events.rs - Added UserPromptSubmit and cwd to CommonEventData
- src/engine/evaluation.rs - Updated to handle prompt field extraction
- src/config/loader.rs - Enhanced for empty string matcher semantics
- examples/policies/user-prompt-submit-example.yaml - Usage documentation
- tests/user_prompt_submit_integration_test.rs - Integration test coverage

## Unlocks

- Prompt validation (API keys, secrets, inappropriate content)
- Dynamic context injection based on user input
- Enhanced security through prompt interception
- Better path handling with authoritative cwd field

## Notes

Implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding significant new capabilities for governing Claude Code interactions at the prompt level.
