# Progress Log for plan 016

## 2025-01-18T15:30:00Z

Reviewed draft plan and created revised plan based on codebase analysis. Key findings:

1. The current YAML structure uses nested HashMaps, so we don't need a new PolicyGroup enum
2. Empty string "" can serve as universal matcher for matcher-less events
3. The cwd field needs to be authoritative from hook data
4. UserPromptSubmit response should focus on exit code 2 + stderr

Key improvements in revised plan:
- Simplified YAML deserialization approach
- Clear handling of cwd field authority
- Prompt as top-level field in EvaluationContext
- Focus on simple response handling (exit code 2)
- Added step to update HookEventType enum first

Next: Begin implementation starting with HookEventType enum update.

## 2025-01-18T16:15:00Z

Completed Phase 1: Core Data Structures

Successfully implemented:
1. Added UserPromptSubmit to HookEventType enum in config/types.rs
2. Added cwd field to CommonEventData struct in engine/events.rs
3. Added UserPromptSubmit variant to HookEvent enum
4. Updated all helper methods (common(), event_name()) to handle new variant
5. Created comprehensive tests in tests/hook_event_updates_test.rs

Key observations:
- The compiler's exhaustive pattern matching helped identify all places needing updates
- Existing tests needed cwd field added for backward compatibility
- New test file created specifically for validating the updates

Tests verify:
- All events properly deserialize with cwd field
- UserPromptSubmit event deserializes correctly with prompt field
- Event helper methods work correctly with new variant

Next: Phase 2 - Policy Engine enhancements

## 2025-01-18T16:45:00Z

Completed Phase 2: Policy Engine Enhancement

Successfully implemented:
1. Added prompt field to EvaluationContext struct (Option<String>)
2. Updated extract_field method to handle "prompt" field extraction
3. Updated build_evaluation_context to:
   - Use authoritative cwd from hook data instead of process cwd
   - Extract prompt from UserPromptSubmit events
   - Set prompt to None for other event types
4. Fixed missing prompt field in ActionExecutor's EvaluationContext creation
5. Created comprehensive tests in tests/evaluation_context_test.rs

Key improvements:
- The cwd field from hook data is now authoritative (using hook_event.common().cwd)
- Prompt field can be used in conditions for UserPromptSubmit events
- Pattern matching supported for detecting sensitive data in prompts
- Maintained backward compatibility by using Option<String> for prompt

Tests verify:
- Prompt field extraction works correctly
- Pattern matching on prompts (e.g., detecting API keys)
- Proper handling when prompt is None
- cwd is correctly used from evaluation context

Next: Phase 3 - Policy Loading for empty string matchers

## 2025-01-18T17:15:00Z

Completed Phase 3: Policy Loading

Successfully implemented:
1. Updated build_ordered_policy_list to handle empty string matchers:
   - Empty string matcher ("") only matches non-tool events (UserPromptSubmit, Notification, etc.)
   - Non-empty matchers only match tool events using regex
   - Clear separation of logic for tool vs non-tool events
2. Added UserPromptSubmit to parse_hook_event method in PolicyLoader
3. Created comprehensive tests in tests/empty_matcher_test.rs

Key design decisions:
- Empty string serves as the convention for "matcher-less" events
- Tool events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse) require non-empty regex matchers
- Non-tool events (UserPromptSubmit, etc.) require empty string matcher
- This maintains backward compatibility while adding clear semantics

Tests verify:
- Empty string matchers correctly match UserPromptSubmit events
- Empty string matchers do NOT match tool events
- YAML loading with empty string matchers works correctly
- Pattern matching on prompts works with empty matcher policies

Next: Phase 4 - Response Logic for UserPromptSubmit

## 2025-01-18T17:45:00Z

Completed Phase 4: Response Logic

Successfully implemented:
1. Updated build_action_context to use authoritative cwd from hook data
2. Verified response logic works correctly for UserPromptSubmit:
   - Block actions use exit code 2 with stderr output
   - Soft feedback uses exit code 0 with stdout output
   - No special handling needed (follows standard pattern)
3. Created comprehensive integration tests in tests/user_prompt_submit_integration_test.rs

Key observations:
- The existing response logic already handles UserPromptSubmit correctly
- PolicyDecision::Block results in exit code 2 (as required)
- Soft feedback (ProvideFeedback action) results in exit code 0
- Manual testing confirmed the implementation works as expected

Tests verify:
- API key detection in prompts blocks correctly (exit code 2)
- Soft feedback for non-blocking conditions works (exit code 0)
- No match scenarios exit cleanly (exit code 0, no output)
- Integration with full CLI and YAML loading works correctly

Next: Phase 5 - Documentation updates

## 2025-01-18T18:00:00Z

Completed Phase 5: Documentation

Successfully implemented:
1. Created comprehensive example policy file:
   - examples/policies/user-prompt-submit-example.yaml
   - Demonstrates blocking secrets, providing warnings, and audit logging
   - Includes detailed comments explaining usage patterns
2. Updated README.md:
   - Added UserPromptSubmit to the Integration section
   - Added example UserPromptSubmit policy to demonstrate empty string matcher
   - Listed all supported hook events

Documentation highlights:
- Clear explanation of empty string matcher requirement
- Multiple use case examples (secrets, malicious requests, audit)
- Field references for conditions (prompt, session_id, etc.)
- Integration with existing policy patterns

Implementation complete! All phases successfully delivered.
