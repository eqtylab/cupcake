# Progress Log for plan 016

## 2025-01-18T15:30:00Z

Reviewed draft plan and created revised plan based on codebase analysis. Key findings:

1. The current YAML structure uses nested HashMaps, so we don't need a new PolicyGroup enum
2. Empty string "" can serve as universal matcher for matcher-less events
3. The cwd field needs to be authoritative from hook data
4. UserPromptSubmit response should focus on exit code 2 + stderr

Key improvements in revised plan:
- Simplified YAML deserialization approach
- Clear handling of cwd field authority
- Prompt as top-level field in EvaluationContext
- Focus on simple response handling (exit code 2)
- Added step to update HookEventType enum first

Next: Begin implementation starting with HookEventType enum update.

Completed Phase 1: Core Data Structures

Successfully implemented:
1. Added UserPromptSubmit to HookEventType enum in config/types.rs
2. Added cwd field to CommonEventData struct in engine/events.rs
3. Added UserPromptSubmit variant to HookEvent enum
4. Updated all helper methods (common(), event_name()) to handle new variant
5. Created comprehensive tests in tests/hook_event_updates_test.rs

Key observations:
- The compiler's exhaustive pattern matching helped identify all places needing updates
- Existing tests needed cwd field added for backward compatibility
- New test file created specifically for validating the updates

Tests verify:
- All events properly deserialize with cwd field
- UserPromptSubmit event deserializes correctly with prompt field
- Event helper methods work correctly with new variant

Next: Phase 2 - Policy Engine enhancements
