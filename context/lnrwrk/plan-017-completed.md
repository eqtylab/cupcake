- Claude Code settings integration
- 25+ passing tests covering all functionality
- Complete replacement of stub init command

## Key Files

- src/cli/tui/ - Main TUI module structure
- src/cli/tui/init/app.rs - Core application and state machine
- src/cli/tui/init/screens/ - All 6 screen implementations
- src/cli/tui/init/discovery.rs - Real file discovery
- src/cli/tui/init/yaml_writer.rs - Stub YAML generation
- src/cli/tui/init/claude_settings.rs - Claude Code integration
- src/cli/commands/init.rs - Updated to launch TUI
- tests/tui_*_test.rs - Comprehensive test coverage

## Unlocks

Ready for next plan to add:
- Real LLM integration for rule extraction
- Actual policy generation from extracted rules
- Full cupcake run command integration
- Production-ready error handling

## Notes

The TUI is fully functional with stub data. Users can:
1. Run `cupcake init` to launch the wizard
2. Discover and select rule files
3. Review and edit mock rules
4. Generate stub YAML files
5. Update Claude Code settings

All UI flows are complete and polished. The foundation is solid for adding real extraction and policy generation in the next plan.
