# Progress Log for plan 017

## 2025-01-21T12:00:00Z

Starting implementation of the interactive TUI init wizard. This replaces the basic scaffolding init command with a sophisticated Terminal User Interface that guides users through:

1. Discovering rule sources (CLAUDE.md, .cursor/rules, etc.)
2. Selecting which sources to include with live preview
3. Optional custom extraction instructions
4. Parallel rule extraction (stubbed for now)
5. Rule review, search, and editing
6. Compilation and sync progress
7. Success summary

Key decisions:
- Using Ratatui for TUI implementation
- Stubbing LLM extraction with mock rules initially
- Simple file discovery using standard Rust patterns
- Phased implementation approach for quality and testing

Implementation phases:
- Phase 1: Core TUI infrastructure (state machine, event loop)
- Phase 2: File discovery and Screen 1
- Phase 3: Modal system and Screens 2-3
- Phase 4: Rule review system and Screens 4-4a
- Phase 5: Compilation and final screens
- Phase 6: Polish and integration

Next: Commit initial plan files and begin Phase 1 implementation.

## 2025-01-21T13:00:00Z

Completed Phase 1 core infrastructure:

1. Added TUI dependencies (ratatui 0.29.0, crossterm 0.29.0, tui-input 0.14.0)
2. Created module structure:
   - src/cli/tui/ - Main TUI module
   - src/cli/tui/init/ - Init wizard implementation
   - src/cli/tui/init/app.rs - Main application and event loop
   - src/cli/tui/init/state.rs - State machine and data structures
   - src/cli/tui/init/events.rs - Event types
   - src/cli/tui/init/theme.rs - Consistent styling
   - src/cli/tui/init/screens/ - Screen implementations
   - src/cli/tui/init/components/ - Reusable UI components

3. Implemented basic state machine with:
   - WizardState enum for screen transitions
   - Event-driven architecture with tokio async support
   - Mock file discovery task
   - Placeholder render/handler methods

Key decisions:
- Using static methods for state-specific handlers to avoid borrow checker issues
- Separating screen rendering into modules
- Event channel for background task communication

Next: Write tests for state transitions and begin Phase 2 (file discovery and Screen 1)

## 2025-01-21T14:00:00Z

Phase 2 progress:
