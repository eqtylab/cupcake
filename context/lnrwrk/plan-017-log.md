# Progress Log for plan 017

## 2025-01-21T12:00:00Z

Starting implementation of the interactive TUI init wizard. This replaces the basic scaffolding init command with a sophisticated Terminal User Interface that guides users through:

1. Discovering rule sources (CLAUDE.md, .cursor/rules, etc.)
2. Selecting which sources to include with live preview
3. Optional custom extraction instructions
4. Parallel rule extraction (stubbed for now)
5. Rule review, search, and editing
6. Compilation and sync progress
7. Success summary

Key decisions:
- Using Ratatui for TUI implementation
- Stubbing LLM extraction with mock rules initially
- Simple file discovery using standard Rust patterns
- Phased implementation approach for quality and testing

Implementation phases:
- Phase 1: Core TUI infrastructure (state machine, event loop)
- Phase 2: File discovery and Screen 1
- Phase 3: Modal system and Screens 2-3
- Phase 4: Rule review system and Screens 4-4a
- Phase 5: Compilation and final screens
- Phase 6: Polish and integration

Next: Commit initial plan files and begin Phase 1 implementation.
