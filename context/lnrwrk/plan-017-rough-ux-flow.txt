This is the rough flow of what we want to do:
The onboarding experience would:
1. find all claude.md files in the repo, but also other coding agent rules (like cursorrules, or the curso rules folder). this should be really fast right?
2. based on found files, give user a list and option select/deselect each file or folder. maybe as they scroll the list they would see file preview on the right side? if it is a directory we might show a preview of each file down in the dir? hmm.
3. after selecting the rules they want. There is an option for any custom prompt. If not, they init process begins
4. for each rules file, we will use our llm tooling to extract a list of each rule. this is fast and also happens in parallel. but a user should see like a loading indicator next to each.
5. after all initial potential rules are found, the user can select or deselect each rule found (initially selected)... they also need to be able to edit each rule.
6. the final stage will be a policy compilation step, and claude code hooks sync.
