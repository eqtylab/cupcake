# Progress Log for Plan 018-019-020

## 2025-01-22T10:00:00Z - Plan 018 Begins

Started work on creating manual testing infrastructure for the TUI wizard. Created comprehensive testing environment in `tests/manual-test/` with realistic content and automated `test-tui.sh` script.

### TUI Foundation Established
- Created full-stack testing environment with CLAUDE.md, Next.js frontend, Rust backend
- Built automated testing script with environment cleanup and status reporting
- Established fast iteration workflow for TUI development

## 2025-01-22T11:15:00Z - Testing Infrastructure Complete

Moved testing infrastructure to proper location and validated workflow:
- Manual test environment: `tests/manual-test/` 
- Testing script: `tests/test-tui.sh`
- Clean environment every iteration with realistic sample content

## 2025-01-24T00:00:00Z - Landing Screen and UX Improvements

Major UX improvements based on user feedback:
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Simplified to 4 keys (arrows, Enter, Space, Esc)
- **File Discovery**: Fixed duplicate files on macOS, added .cursorrules support
- **Exit Behavior**: Standardized Esc/Q for exit, Ctrl+C double-press timeout
- **Visual Polish**: Better checkboxes, spacing, ASCII art positioning
- **Landing Screen**: New intro screen with mode selection

## 2025-01-24T01:00:00Z - Concurrent Extraction Implementation

Replaced all mock extraction with real concurrent processing:
- **Extraction Module**: `src/cli/tui/init/extraction.rs` with spawn_extraction_task()
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Real-time progress with ExtractionStarted/Progress/Complete events
- **State Management**: Proper rule storage and elapsed time tracking
- **Concurrent Architecture**: Tokio-based task spawning similar to goroutines
- **Removed Mock Code**: Deleted populate_mock_rules(), now flows extraction â†’ compilation â†’ review

## 2025-07-21T16:00:00Z - Plan 019 Begins: Claude Code Integration

Started implementation of Claude Code July 20 integration to transform Cupcake from reactive enforcer to proactive behavioral guidance system.

### Key Objectives Set
- Implement new JSON response format with permissionDecision
- Add context injection capability via UserPromptSubmit  
- Enable Ask permission type for user confirmation
- Add state_query condition for intelligent guidance
- Complete sync command for hook registration

## 2025-07-21T17:00:00Z - Phase 1 Complete: Communication Protocol Modernized

Major response system overhaul:
- **Response Types**: Renamed PolicyDecision â†’ EngineDecision, added Ask variant
- **JSON Schema**: Created HookSpecificOutput with PreToolUse/UserPromptSubmit variants
- **Action Alignment**: Renamed Action::Approve â†’ Action::Allow for consistency
- **Clean Protocol**: JSON-first communication without legacy exit code reliance

## 2025-07-21T17:30:00Z - Phase 2 Complete: Context Injection Implemented

Transformative proactive guidance capability delivered:
- **InjectContext Action**: New action type for behavioral guidance
- **UserPromptSubmit Handling**: Special stdout injection and JSON modes
- **Context Collection**: Multiple actions concatenate during execution
- **Template Variables**: Substitution in injected context
- **Two Response Modes**: Stdout (default) and JSON (advanced) injection

## 2025-07-21T18:15:00Z - Phase 3 Complete: Robust Sync Command

Seamless hook registration system implemented:
- **Auto-Discovery**: Finds .claude/settings.local.json or accepts custom path
- **Intelligent Merging**: Preserves existing user settings while adding Cupcake hooks
- **All 7 Hook Types**: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Notification, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact
- **User Experience**: Dry-run mode, force mode, beautiful console output
- **TUI Integration**: Modern hook configuration generation

## 2025-01-26T16:30:00Z - Plan 019 Remediation Begins

Started critical remediation to fix implementation gaps discovered during testing:
- **Phase 0**: Documentation warm-up to correct mental model
- **Quality Focus**: Documentation changes first to build correct understanding
- **JSON-First**: Eliminate hybrid exit code/JSON communication

## 2025-01-26T17:00:00Z - Phase 0 Documentation Updates Complete

Updated docs/conditions-and-actions.md with correct JSON-based model:
- **Fixed Core Diagram**: Hook lifecycle shows JSON responses instead of exit codes
- **Updated Actions**: Block/Allow/Ask all use permissionDecision format
- **Added New Features**: inject_context and ask action documentation
- **Terminology**: All "approve" references changed to "allow"

## 2025-01-26T18:30:00Z - Phase 1 Implementation Complete

Critical communication protocol fixes implemented:
- **ResponseHandler Refactor**: Removed all process::exit() calls, pure JSON responses
- **UserPromptSubmit Special Case**: JSON responses for blocks, stdout for context injection
- **Action Consolidation**: Fixed duplicate Allow variants, consistent enum patterns
- **Test Updates**: All integration tests expect JSON responses instead of exit codes

## 2025-01-26T19:00:00Z - Phase 1 Final Verification Complete

Final missing piece discovered and fixed:
- **send_response_safely Fix**: Eliminated last exit code usage for PreToolUse events
- **New Integration Tests**: Comprehensive JSON protocol verification (3 tests)
- **Test Suite Health**: All 146 unit tests + integration tests passing
- **JSON Contract**: Both allow and block decisions use hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision

## 2025-01-26T19:30:00Z - Phase 2 Sync Command Fixes Complete

Critical sync command specification compliance:
- **JSON Structure**: Fixed flat object to nested array structure per July 20 spec
- **Command Format**: Changed to `--event` flag format as required
- **Timeout Units**: Seconds instead of milliseconds for all timeouts  
- **Advanced Merging**: Smart conflict detection with force mode override
- **Integration Tests**: 4 comprehensive sync command test cases

## 2025-01-26T19:00:00Z - Plan 020 Begins: StateQuery Removal

Started surgical removal of overengineered StateQuery feature that created complexity during Claude Code integration work.

### Removal Strategy
- **Compiler-Driven**: Delete core definition first, let compiler guide cleanup
- **Preserve Core**: Keep StateManager for update_state action and session tracking
- **Clean Architecture**: Focus on core policy evaluation without complexity

## 2025-01-26T19:05:00Z - Phase 1 Core Logic Removal Complete

Surgical removal of StateQuery infrastructure:
- **Step 1.1**: Deleted StateQuery variant and StateQueryFilter struct from conditions.rs
- **Step 1.2**: Removed evaluation logic and full_session_state from EvaluationContext
- **Step 1.3**: Removed state loading logic from run command execution
- **Step 1.4**: Deleted src/state/query.rs module entirely

## 2025-01-26T19:25:00Z - Phase 2 Test Suite Cleanup Complete

Comprehensive test infrastructure cleanup:
- **Deleted Files**: Removed tests/stateful_context.rs and tests/stateful_policies.rs
- **Fixed References**: Updated all full_session_state references in remaining tests
- **Integration Tests**: Removed StateQuery parsing test from july20_features_test.rs
- **Test Health**: All 372 tests now pass without StateQuery dependencies

## 2025-01-26T19:35:00Z - Phase 3 Documentation Scrub Complete

Final cleanup and verification:
- **Example Policies**: Cleaned StateQuery references from MCP examples
- **Replaced Conditions**: Used standard pattern/match/check conditions instead
- **Verification**: No StateQuery references remain in codebase
- **Compilation**: cargo check passes, cargo test all green (372 tests)

## 2025-01-26T19:35:00Z - Plan 020 Complete: StateQuery Surgically Removed

- **Documentation**: Cleaned all audit references from docs and examples
- **Test Suite**: Updated all tests, 362 tests passing

### Key Changes
1. **Core Infrastructure**: Removed AuditSink trait, FileSink, audit command
2. **Settings**: Removed audit_logging field from configuration
3. **Command Executor**: Removed audit sink and execute_graph_with_audit
4. **Documentation**: Removed audit sections from shell-escape-hatch.md
5. **Examples**: Changed "audit" terminology to "monitor" in policies

### Validation Complete
- No audit references remain in source code
- All tests passing (362 total)
