# Plan 018 Progress Log

## 2025-01-22T10:00:00Z

Started work on creating manual testing infrastructure for the TUI wizard based on user request for:
1. A new testing directory for manually testing the TUI
2. A script to remove any generated policies and launch us into that directory with the TUI

## 2025-01-22T10:30:00Z

Created comprehensive manual testing environment:

### Created `manual-test/` Directory Structure
- `manual-test/CLAUDE.md` - Sample rule definitions with realistic policy examples covering:
  - Git workflow rules (tests before commit, code review requirements)
  - Code quality rules (linter requirements, documentation updates)
  - Security rules (no API keys, dangerous command blocking)
  - File management rules (architecture doc requirements)
- `manual-test/README.md` - Instructions for testing and expected behavior
- `manual-test/.claude/settings.local.json` - Pre-configured Claude Code settings
- `manual-test/src/main.rs` - Sample Rust application code
- `manual-test/src/lib.rs` - Sample library with modules for testing
- `manual-test/package.json` - Sample package configuration

The test environment provides realistic content that should generate meaningful mock rules during TUI testing.

Created `test-tui.sh` script with comprehensive functionality:

### Script Features
- **Build Verification**: Ensures cupcake binary is up-to-date before testing
- **Environment Cleanup**: 
  - Removes `guardrails/` directory
  - Removes `.cupcake/` state directory
  - Resets `.claude/settings.local.json` to default state
- **Status Reporting**: Shows environment status and discovered files
- **TUI Launch**: Changes to test directory and launches `cupcake init`
- **Post-Run Analysis**: 
  - Reports what files were generated
  - Shows policy counts and hook status
  - Provides tips for further testing

### Script Output
The script provides colored output with clear status indicators:
- 🧁 Cupcake branding and clear section headers
- ✅/❌ Status indicators for all operations
- 📁 Environment status summary
- 📋 File discovery preview
- 🚀 TUI launch notification
- 📊 Generated files summary
- 🔄 Instructions for repeat testing

Made script executable with `chmod +x test-tui.sh`.

### Testing Workflow Established

The manual testing workflow is now:
1. Run `./test-tui.sh` from repository root
2. Script cleans environment and launches TUI
3. Test all 6 phases of the TUI wizard
4. Review generated files and settings
5. Run script again for quick iteration

### Benefits for Development
- **Fast Iteration**: Clean environment every time
- **Realistic Testing**: Sample content that exercises all TUI features
- **Clear Feedback**: Script shows exactly what was generated
- **No Manual Cleanup**: Automated removal of generated files
- **Consistent Environment**: Same starting state every time

## 2025-01-22T11:15:00Z

Moved testing infrastructure to proper location:
- Moved `manual-test/` to `tests/manual-test/` 
- Moved `test-tui.sh` to `tests/test-tui.sh`
- Updated all script paths to work from tests directory:
  - Build command: `cd .. && cargo build`
  - Test directory: `cd tests/manual-test`
  - Context directory: `../../context`
  - Binary path: `../../target/debug/cupcake`
  - Instructions: `cd .. && ./test-tui.sh`

### Landing Screen Improvements

Based on user feedback, made several UX improvements to the TUI landing screen:

1. **Keyboard Navigation Simplification**
   - Removed complex keyboard shortcuts
   - Swapped Enter and Space keys for more intuitive behavior:
     - Enter now toggles selection (was Space)
     - Space now continues to next screen (was Enter)
   - Simplified to only 4 keys: arrows, Enter, Space, Esc

2. **File Discovery Fixes**
   - Fixed duplicate Claude files showing on macOS case-insensitive filesystem
   - Added canonical path deduplication
   - Added `.cursorrules` pattern for Cursor discovery

3. **Exit Behavior Standardization**
   - Made Esc and Q both exit the app (was Esc=back, Q=quit)
   - Added Ctrl+C double-press exit with 1 second timeout
   - Updated help text to show "Esc or Q"

4. **Visual Improvements**
   - Changed checkboxes from small `☑`/`☐` to larger `[✓]`/`[ ]` with color
   - Fixed header text cutoff by shortening titles
   - Added "[ Press Space to continue ]" prompt

5. **Landing Screen Creation**
   - Created new landing screen with cupcake ASCII art
   - Added intro text explaining the init process
   - Added mode selection (auto-discovery vs manual)
   - Multiple iterations on layout and spacing based on feedback

6. **ASCII Art Updates**
   - Replaced large cupcake ASCII with simpler dog ASCII for small terminals
   - Reduced excessive vertical spacing
   - Positioned title text beside ASCII art instead of below
   - Used horizontal layout for better space utilization

7. **Navigation Updates**
   - Changed mode switching from Tab to Up/Down arrow keys
   - More intuitive for vertical mode selection
   - Updated help text to show "↑↓ to switch modes"

### Files Modified
- `src/cli/tui/init/app.rs` - Event handling and state management
- `src/cli/tui/init/screens/landing.rs` - New landing screen implementation
- `src/cli/tui/init/screens/discovery.rs` - Visual improvements
- `src/cli/tui/init/discovery.rs` - File discovery patterns
- `src/cli/tui/init/state.rs` - Added LandingState
- `src/cli/tui/init/screens/mod.rs` - Added landing module

## Status: Complete

Manual testing infrastructure is properly organized in the tests directory. The `tests/test-tui.sh` script provides a fast, repeatable way to test the TUI with realistic full-stack content and automatic cleanup.

Landing screen and keyboard navigation improvements have been implemented based on user feedback, making the TUI more intuitive for non-CLI users.

Next developer can immediately start testing by running `cd tests && ./test-tui.sh` and will get a complete workflow with clear feedback on what the TUI generates.
