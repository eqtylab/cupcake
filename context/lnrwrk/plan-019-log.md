# Progress Log for plan 019

## 2025-01-25T16:00:00Z

Started implementation of Claude Code July 20 integration. This plan transforms Cupcake from a reactive policy enforcer to a proactive behavioral guidance system.

Key objectives:
- Implement new JSON response format with permissionDecision
- Add context injection capability via UserPromptSubmit  
- Enable Ask permission type for user confirmation
- Add state_query condition for intelligent guidance
- Complete sync command for hook registration

Following 5-phase approach as defined in plan-019-plan.md and plan-019-plan-ammendment-phase5.md.

Guiding principles:
1. Hook Contract is King - strict adherence to Claude Code's JSON schema
2. Secure by Default - maintaining command injection protection
3. Policy is the API - keeping YAML simple and expressive
4. State is for What, Not How - clean separation of concerns
5. Seamless User Workflow - robust sync and intuitive setup

Beginning Phase 1: Modernizing the Communication Protocol.
