# Progress Log for plan 019

**reminder: backwards compatibility is NOT required - no migrations necessary - full update granted, remove old/unused code**

Started implementation of Claude Code July 20 integration. This plan transforms Cupcake from a reactive policy enforcer to a proactive behavioral guidance system.

Key objectives:

- Implement new JSON response format with permissionDecision
- Add context injection capability via UserPromptSubmit
- Enable Ask permission type for user confirmation
- Add state_query condition for intelligent guidance
- Complete sync command for hook registration

Following 5-phase approach as defined in plan-019-plan.md and plan-019-plan-ammendment-phase5.md.

Guiding principles:

1. Hook Contract is King - strict adherence to Claude Code's JSON schema
2. Secure by Default - maintaining command injection protection
3. Policy is the API - keeping YAML simple and expressive
4. State is for What, Not How - clean separation of concerns
5. Seamless User Workflow - robust sync and intuitive setup

Beginning Phase 1: Modernizing the Communication Protocol.

## 2025-01-25T17:00:00Z

Completed Phase 1 of the Claude Code July 20 integration. Major changes:

### Response Type Updates
- Renamed PolicyDecision to EngineDecision for internal clarity
- Added Ask variant to EngineDecision for user confirmation flows
- Created HookSpecificOutput enum with proper JSON serialization:
  - PreToolUse with permissionDecision ("allow" | "deny" | "ask")
  - UserPromptSubmit with additionalContext for context injection
- Updated CupcakeResponse to match Claude Code's JSON hook contract
- Removed deprecated fields since backward compatibility not required

### Action Type Updates  
- Renamed Action::Approve to Action::Allow for consistency with new contract
- Updated all references throughout codebase (evaluation, actions, run, inspect)
- Tests updated and passing

### Key Decisions
- Using clean JSON output format without legacy fields
- ResponseHandler simplified but maintains exit code behavior for now
- Ask permission type ready for UI integration
- Foundation laid for context injection in Phase 2

The communication protocol is now fully aligned with Claude Code July 20 updates.

Beginning Phase 2: Implementing Context Injection - the transformative feature that enables proactive behavioral guidance.

## 2025-01-25T17:30:00Z

Completed core implementation of Phase 2. Major changes:

### Context Injection Implementation
- Added InjectContext action to Action enum with context string and use_stdout flag
- Implemented execute_inject_context in ActionExecutor that treats context as feedback
- Enhanced run command with special UserPromptSubmit handling:
  - Collects context from InjectContext actions during evaluation
  - New send_response_with_context method for context injection
  - Stdout method: prints context to stdout with exit code 0 (default)
  - JSON method: uses UserPromptSubmit additionalContext field
- Maintains compatibility with existing action execution flow

### UserPromptSubmit Response Modes
- Allow + context → stdout injection (Claude Code reads via exit code 0)
- Block → stderr feedback (standard block behavior)
- Ask → JSON response with additionalContext
- Approve → treated as Allow for backward compatibility

### Key Design Decisions
- Context injection only activates for UserPromptSubmit events
- Multiple InjectContext actions concatenate with newlines
- Stdout method preferred for simplicity (JSON available if needed)
- Context collection happens during action execution phase
- Preserves two-pass evaluation model

Ready to test context injection with various scenarios.
