# Plan 019 Remediation Log

## 2025-01-26T16:30:00Z - Starting Phase 0 Documentation Warm-up

Beginning the remediation of plan-019 critical implementation gaps. Starting with Phase 0 warm-up exercise to correct mental model through documentation updates BEFORE touching any code.

### Quality Execution Principles
- **Focus**: Complete documentation changes first to internalize correct JSON-based model
- **No Code Yet**: This phase is purely documentation to build correct understanding
- **Verify Against Spec**: Every change must align with Claude Code July 20 hooks.md

### Phase 0 Documentation Tasks Created
1. Fix Core Diagram - Replace exit code flow with JSON response flow
2. Update Block Action Description - Explain JSON permissionDecision:deny
3. Rename Approve to Allow Section - Update terminology and explain JSON
4. Add Ask Action Section - Document new ask capability
5. Verify all changes against July 20 specification

The goal is to have docs/conditions-and-actions.md accurately reflect the JSON-based communication protocol that Cupcake SHOULD be using. Only after this mental model is corrected through documentation will we proceed to make the code match the documentation.

Next step: Read current docs/conditions-and-actions.md to understand baseline.

## 2025-01-26T17:00:00Z - Phase 0 Documentation Updates Completed

Successfully updated docs/conditions-and-actions.md with the following changes:

### Documentation Changes Made:
1. ✅ **Fixed Core Diagram** - Updated Hook Lifecycle sequence diagram to show JSON responses:
   - Changed "Exit 2 + Feedback" to "JSON Response (e.g., {"permissionDecision": "deny", ...})"
   - Changed "Exit 0" references to "JSON Response ({"permissionDecision": "allow"})"
   - Updated hard action types to include "Block, Ask, Allow"

2. ✅ **Updated Action Descriptions**:
   - Block with Feedback: Now explains JSON `permissionDecision: "deny"`
   - Renamed "Approve" to "Allow": Explains JSON `permissionDecision: "allow"`
   - Added new "Ask" action: Documents JSON `permissionDecision: "ask"`
   - Added "Inject Context" action documentation

3. ✅ **Fixed All References**:
   - Updated action types list (added inject_context and ask)
   - Updated condition types list (added state_query)
   - Fixed all "approve" references to "allow" throughout document
   - Updated execution flow to mention JSON responses instead of exit codes
   - Updated all diagrams to include new action types

### Quality Checks:
- All changes align with Claude Code July 20 hooks.md specification
- JSON response format matches exactly: `{"permissionDecision": "allow|deny|ask", "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}`
- Terminology is consistent throughout (allow not approve)
- New features (ask, inject_context, state_query) are documented

### Mental Model Shift:
The documentation now correctly reflects that Cupcake SHOULD:
- Always communicate decisions via JSON on stdout
- Never use exit codes to communicate decisions (except exit 0 for success)
- Support the new "ask" permission model
- Handle context injection for UserPromptSubmit events

This completes Phase 0. The developer now has correct documentation that serves as the specification for the code fixes to follow.
