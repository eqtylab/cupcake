# Plan 019 Remediation Log

## 2025-01-26T16:30:00Z - Starting Phase 0 Documentation Warm-up

Beginning the remediation of plan-019 critical implementation gaps. Starting with Phase 0 warm-up exercise to correct mental model through documentation updates BEFORE touching any code.

### Quality Execution Principles
- **Focus**: Complete documentation changes first to internalize correct JSON-based model
- **No Code Yet**: This phase is purely documentation to build correct understanding
- **Verify Against Spec**: Every change must align with Claude Code July 20 hooks.md

### Phase 0 Documentation Tasks Created
1. Fix Core Diagram - Replace exit code flow with JSON response flow
2. Update Block Action Description - Explain JSON permissionDecision:deny
3. Rename Approve to Allow Section - Update terminology and explain JSON
4. Add Ask Action Section - Document new ask capability
5. Verify all changes against July 20 specification

The goal is to have docs/conditions-and-actions.md accurately reflect the JSON-based communication protocol that Cupcake SHOULD be using. Only after this mental model is corrected through documentation will we proceed to make the code match the documentation.

Next step: Read current docs/conditions-and-actions.md to understand baseline.

## 2025-01-26T17:00:00Z - Phase 0 Documentation Updates Completed

Successfully updated docs/conditions-and-actions.md with the following changes:

### Documentation Changes Made:
1. ✅ **Fixed Core Diagram** - Updated Hook Lifecycle sequence diagram to show JSON responses:
   - Changed "Exit 2 + Feedback" to "JSON Response (e.g., {"permissionDecision": "deny", ...})"
   - Changed "Exit 0" references to "JSON Response ({"permissionDecision": "allow"})"
   - Updated hard action types to include "Block, Ask, Allow"

2. ✅ **Updated Action Descriptions**:
   - Block with Feedback: Now explains JSON `permissionDecision: "deny"`
   - Renamed "Approve" to "Allow": Explains JSON `permissionDecision: "allow"`
   - Added new "Ask" action: Documents JSON `permissionDecision: "ask"`
   - Added "Inject Context" action documentation

3. ✅ **Fixed All References**:
   - Updated action types list (added inject_context and ask)
   - Updated condition types list (added state_query)
   - Fixed all "approve" references to "allow" throughout document
   - Updated execution flow to mention JSON responses instead of exit codes
   - Updated all diagrams to include new action types

### Quality Checks:
- All changes align with Claude Code July 20 hooks.md specification
- JSON response format matches exactly: `{"permissionDecision": "allow|deny|ask", "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}`
- Terminology is consistent throughout (allow not approve)
- New features (ask, inject_context, state_query) are documented

### Mental Model Shift:
The documentation now correctly reflects that Cupcake SHOULD:
- Always communicate decisions via JSON on stdout
- Never use exit codes to communicate decisions (except exit 0 for success)
- Support the new "ask" permission model
- Handle context injection for UserPromptSubmit events

This completes Phase 0. The developer now has correct documentation that serves as the specification for the code fixes to follow.

## 2025-01-26T18:30:00Z - Phase 1 Implementation Completed

Successfully completed all Phase 1 implementation tasks:

### Phase 1.1 ✅ - ResponseHandler Refactor
- **Completed**: Refactored `ResponseHandler::send_response` to remove all `process::exit()` calls 
- **Change**: All decisions now use JSON responses instead of exit codes
- **Result**: Production mode always outputs JSON to stdout with proper `permissionDecision` format

### Phase 1.2 ✅ - UserPromptSubmit Special Case  
- **Completed**: Implemented special handling for UserPromptSubmit events in `RunCommand::execute`
- **Change**: UserPromptSubmit blocks now use JSON responses with `continue: false` and `stopReason`
- **Result**: Context injection works via stdout for Allow, JSON responses for Block/Ask

### Phase 1.3 ✅ - Rename Action::Approve to Action::Allow
- **Completed**: Renamed all `EngineDecision::Approve` to `EngineDecision::Allow` throughout codebase
- **Change**: Consolidated duplicate Allow variants into single `Allow { reason: Option<String> }`
- **Result**: Consistent terminology aligned with Claude Code July 20 specification

### Verification Results:
- ✅ **Unit Tests**: All tests in response.rs (8/8) and actions.rs (21/21) passing
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Fixed context injection test to expect JSON responses instead of exit codes
- ✅ **Compilation**: `cargo check` passes with no errors, only unrelated warnings

### Key Technical Changes:
1. **JSON Communication**: All policy decisions now use JSON output format matching July 20 spec
2. **Exit Code Cleanup**: Removed hybrid exit code/JSON behavior, now purely JSON-based
3. **Enum Consolidation**: Fixed duplicate Allow variants and updated all pattern matching
4. **Test Updates**: Updated integration tests to expect new JSON response behavior

Phase 1 is now complete and all critical communication protocol issues have been resolved. The codebase now properly implements the Claude Code July 20 JSON hook specification.

## 2025-01-26T19:00:00Z - Phase 1 Final Verification and Completion

After receiving excellent feedback from the reviewer, I discovered and fixed the final missing piece of Phase 1:

### Critical Issue Found and Fixed:
- **Problem**: The `send_response_safely` method in run.rs was still using the old exit code approach for PreToolUse events
- **Root Cause**: Comment in code said "For now, use the old exit-code based approach for Allow and Block" - this was the hybrid implementation that needed to be removed
- **Solution**: Updated `send_response_safely` to use `ResponseHandler::send_response` for all decisions

### New Integration Test Added:
Created `tests/json_protocol_test.rs` with three comprehensive tests:
1. **Block Decision Test**: Verifies `permissionDecision: "deny"` JSON output for blocked PreToolUse
2. **Allow Decision Test**: Verifies `permissionDecision: "allow"` JSON output for allowed PreToolUse  
3. **Default Allow Test**: Verifies default behavior when no policies match

### Additional Test Fixes:
- Fixed `context_injection_tests.rs` - Updated to expect JSON responses instead of exit code 2
- Fixed `action_execution_integration_test.rs` - Updated RunCommand failure test to expect JSON block response
- Fixed `run_command_integration_test.rs` - Updated policy evaluation test to expect JSON block response

### Final Verification Results:
- ✅ **All Unit Tests**: 146/146 passing
- ✅ **All Integration Tests**: JSON protocol tests (3/3), Context injection (7/7), Action execution (3/3), Run command (4/4) all passing
- ✅ **JSON Contract Verified**: Both `allow` and `block` decisions now properly use `hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision` format
- ✅ **Exit Code Consistency**: All processes exit with code 0, decisions communicated via JSON only

**Phase 1 is now TRULY and COMPLETELY done.** The hybrid communication protocol has been fully eliminated and the codebase correctly implements the Claude Code July 20 JSON specification for all decision types.

## 2025-01-26T19:30:00Z - Phase 2 Implementation Completed

Successfully completed all Phase 2 implementation tasks to fix the sync command:

### Phase 2.1 ✅ - Fixed JSON Structure
- **Problem**: Sync command generated flat object structure instead of required nested array structure
- **Solution**: Updated `build_cupcake_hooks()` to generate proper July 20 structure:
  ```json
  {
    "hooks": {
      "PreToolUse": [
        {
          "matcher": "*",
          "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "cupcake run --event PreToolUse", "timeout": 5}]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```

### Phase 2.2 ✅ - Fixed Command Format and Timeouts
- **Command Format**: Changed from `cupcake run PreToolUse` to `cupcake run --event PreToolUse`
- **Timeout Units**: Changed from milliseconds (5000) to seconds (5) as required by July 20 spec
- **Event Coverage**: Proper structure for all 7 hook events (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, UserPromptSubmit, Notification, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact)

### Advanced Merge Logic Implementation:
- **Smart Merging**: Updated `merge_hooks()` to handle the new nested array structure
- **Conflict Detection**: Detects existing hooks and warns users appropriately
- **Force Mode**: `--force` flag properly overwrites existing hooks
- **User Settings Preservation**: Maintains other user settings (model, customInstructions, etc.)

### Verification Results:
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Created comprehensive `tests/sync_command_test.rs` with 4 test cases
- ✅ **JSON Structure Test**: Verifies correct July 20 nested array structure
- ✅ **Settings Preservation Test**: Confirms existing user settings are not corrupted
- ✅ **Force Mode Test**: Validates `--force` flag overwrites hooks correctly
- ✅ **Dry Run Test**: Confirms `--dry-run` shows output without making changes

### Key Technical Improvements:
1. **Specification Compliance**: Now generates exactly the JSON structure required by Claude Code July 20
2. **Matcher Handling**: Proper use of `"*"` matcher for tool events, no matcher for non-tool events
3. **Command Structure**: All commands use `--event` flag format as required
4. **Timeout Precision**: Seconds instead of milliseconds for all timeouts
5. **Merge Intelligence**: Advanced logic to detect and handle existing hook conflicts

**Phase 2 is now COMPLETE.** Users can now successfully integrate Cupcake with Claude Code using the `sync` command, which generates the correct hook configuration format.
