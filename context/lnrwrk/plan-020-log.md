# Progress Log for Plan 020

## 2025-01-26T19:00:00Z

Starting plan-020: Remove StateQuery feature to eliminate overengineering

Created todos for surgical removal plan:
- Phase 1: Core Logic Removal (4 steps)
- Phase 2: Test Suite Cleanup  
- Phase 3: Documentation Scrub
- Verification

Beginning with Step 1.1: Delete StateQuery condition from src/config/conditions.rs

## 2025-01-26T19:05:00Z

‚úÖ Step 1.1 COMPLETED: Deleted StateQuery from src/config/conditions.rs
- Removed StateQuery variant from Condition enum
- Deleted StateQueryFilter struct 
- Deleted default_expect_exists helper function
- Removed test_state_query_serialization test

The project no longer compiles (expected). Moving to Step 1.2.

## 2025-01-26T19:10:00Z

‚úÖ Step 1.2 COMPLETED: Removed StateQuery evaluation logic from src/engine/conditions.rs
- Removed StateQuery match arm from evaluate method
- Deleted entire evaluate_state_query method (78 lines)
- Removed full_session_state field from EvaluationContext struct
- Updated test context creation

Moving to Step 1.3: Remove state loading logic from src/cli/commands/run.rs

## 2025-01-26T19:15:00Z

‚úÖ Step 1.3 COMPLETED: Removed state loading logic from src/cli/commands/run.rs
- Removed needs_state checking logic (10 lines)
- Removed condition_uses_state_query helper method (12 lines)
- Removed full_session_state assignment in build_evaluation_context
- Removed comment about state loading

Moving to Step 1.4: Delete src/state/query.rs and update mod.rs

## 2025-01-26T19:20:00Z

‚úÖ Step 1.4 COMPLETED: Deleted query module
- Deleted src/state/query.rs entirely
- Removed query module reference from src/state/mod.rs
- Removed StateQuery re-export

üéØ PHASE 1 COMPLETE: Core StateQuery logic surgically removed

Moving to Phase 2: Test Suite Cleanup

## 2025-01-26T19:25:00Z

‚úÖ PHASE 2 COMPLETE: Test suite successfully cleaned up
- Deleted tests/stateful_context.rs and tests/stateful_policies.rs
- Removed test_state_query_condition_parsing from july20_features_test.rs  
- Fixed all full_session_state references in test files
- Removed StateQueryFilter import and test from serialization_tests.rs
- Updated test_complex_policy_with_imports to use pattern condition instead of StateQuery
- All tests now pass ‚úÖ

Moving to Phase 3: Documentation Scrub

## 2025-01-26T19:30:00Z

‚úÖ PHASE 3 COMPLETE: Documentation scrub finished
- Cleaned up StateQuery references from examples/policies/mcp/general-mcp.yaml
- Cleaned up StateQuery references from examples/policies/mcp/filesystem-safety.yaml
- Replaced StateQuery conditions with simpler pattern conditions or user confirmation actions
- All example policies now use standard condition types (pattern, match, check, etc.)

Moving to final verification step

## 2025-01-26T19:35:00Z

‚úÖ VERIFICATION COMPLETE: StateQuery completely removed
- ‚úÖ cargo check: Compiles successfully (5 warnings, no errors)
- ‚úÖ cargo test: All 457 tests pass
- ‚úÖ Search verification: No StateQuery references remain in main codebase
- ‚úÖ Example policies cleaned up and functional

üéØ PLAN-020 COMPLETE: StateQuery feature surgically removed

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Core Logic**: Removed StateQuery condition variant and evaluation engine
2. **State System**: Deleted src/state/query.rs module entirely
3. **Test Suite**: Removed stateful test files and cleaned up all references
4. **Documentation**: Updated all examples to use standard conditions
5. **Verification**: Full compilation and test success

### Impact:
- ‚ùå Removed: StateQuery condition type from policy YAML
- ‚ùå Removed: state_query field matching in conditions
- ‚ùå Removed: Historical tool usage queries
- ‚ùå Removed: Time-based workflow conditions
- ‚úÖ Retained: All other condition types (pattern, match, check, and/or/not)
- ‚úÖ Retained: All action types and policy functionality
- ‚úÖ Retained: MCP tool pattern matching
- ‚úÖ Retained: Context injection and behavioral guidance

The codebase is now simplified and focused on the core policy evaluation without overengineered stateful features.
