# Cupcake: Deterministic Guardrails for Your AI Coding Agent

Cupcake is a high-speed policy enforcement engine that integrates directly with Claude Code to act as its deterministic conscience. It ensures that every action the AI agent takes—from editing a file to running a command—adheres to your project's specific rules, conventions, and safety requirements. It bridges the critical gap between providing helpful suggestions to an AI and enforcing unbreakable guarantees.

The core problem Cupcake solves is that while `CLAUDE.md` is excellent for giving an AI context and memory, it provides suggestions, not mandates. An AI, like any developer, can misinterpret, forget, or fail to apply these guidelines, leading to inconsistent or incorrect results. For professional development, and especially in enterprise environments, teams need certainty. You need to know that tests will always be run before a commit, that a critical file will never be edited without the proper context, and that your team's coding standards will be followed every single time. Cupcake provides this certainty.

The process is designed to be seamless. You continue to write your project's rules and conventions in natural language within your `CLAUDE.md` files. Then, you run a single command: `cupcake init`. Cupcake uses Claude Code's own intelligence to read your rules and automatically translate them into a structured YAML guardrails configuration. From that moment on, Cupcake works silently in the background. It intercepts every action Claude Code attempts, evaluates it against your policies in milliseconds, and ensures compliance.

What makes Cupcake so valuable is its intelligent and helpful approach to enforcement. It understands that not all rules are equal. If Claude Code violates multiple stylistic guidelines, Cupcake doesn't play a frustrating game of whack-a-mole; it aggregates all the feedback and presents it in a single, comprehensive list so the agent can fix everything at once. If a critical security or workflow rule is violated, Cupcake immediately blocks the action and provides clear, actionable feedback on the show-stopping issue, while still including the other stylistic notes for context. This "two-pass" system ensures that the AI is both efficient and safe, correcting all minor issues in one go while being stopped by what truly matters.

In essence, Cupcake provides the trust layer for agentic software development. It empowers developers and organizations to confidently deploy AI coding agents, knowing that a fast, reliable, and intelligent set of guardrails is always active, ensuring every line of code produced is not just functional, but also compliant, safe, and correct.
