# Policies

Cupcake uses policies to control what AI coding agents can and cannot do. You have two options:

## [Built-in Policies](builtins.md)

Pre-built security policies that you can enable and configure in your `rulebook.yml`. Battle-tested rules for common security scenarios.

## [Custom Policies](custom.md)

Write your own policies in OPA Rego for complete control over agent behavior. Define exactly what tools and commands are allowed.
