## Introduction

**Cupcake** is a policy enforcement layer for AI coding agents that delivers better performance, reliability, and security **without consuming model context**.

- **Deterministic rule-following** for your agents
- **Boost performance** by moving rules out of context and into guarantees
- **Trigger alerts** when agents repeatedly violate rules

Cupcake intercepts agent tool calls and evaluates them against **user-defined rules** written in **[Open Policy Agent (OPA) Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/)**. Agent actions can be blocked or auto-corrected, with reactive automation for tasks you don't need to rely on the agent to conduct.

## Why Cupcake?

Modern AI agents are powerful but inconsistent at following operational and security rules, especially as context grows. Cupcake turns the rules you already maintain (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT.md`, `.cursor/rules`) into **enforceable guardrails** that run before actions execute.

- **Multi-harness support** with first-class integrations for **Claude Code** and **Cursor**
- **Governance-as-code** using OPA/Rego compiled to WebAssembly for fast, sandboxed evaluation
- **Enterprise-ready** controls: allow/deny/review, audit trails, and proactive warnings

## How It Works

Cupcake sits in the agent hook path. When an agent proposes an action (e.g., run a shell command, edit a file), the details are sent to Cupcake. Cupcake evaluates your policies and returns a decision in milliseconds:

**Allow** · **Block** · **Warn** · **Require Review**

```text
Agent → (proposed action) → Cupcake → (policy decision) → Agent runtime
```

### Core Capabilities

- **Block specific tool calls** - Prevent use of particular tools or arguments based on policy
- **Behavioral guidance** - Inject lightweight, contextful reminders back to the agent
- **MCP support** - Govern Model Context Protocol tools (e.g., `mcp__memory__*`, `mcp__github__*`)
- **Signals (real-time context)** - Pull facts from the environment (current Git branch, changed files, deployment target) and make policy decisions on them

## Supported Harnesses

Cupcake provides native integrations for multiple AI coding agents:

| Harness | Status | Integration Guide |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** | ✅ Fully Supported | [Setup Guide](/getting-started/installation) |
| **[Cursor](https://cursor.com)** | ✅ Fully Supported | [Setup Guide](/getting-started/installation) |

Each harness uses native event formats—no normalization layer. Policies are physically separated by harness (`policies/claude/`, `policies/cursor/`) to ensure clarity and full access to harness-specific capabilities.

## Getting Started

Install Cupcake and set up your first policy in minutes. Check out our [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation) to get started.

## Key Features

- **Fast evaluation** - Sub-millisecond for cached policies in typical setups
- **No token consumption** - Policies run outside the model and return structured decisions
- **Model-agnostic** - Works with any AI coding agent through harness-specific integrations
- **Sandboxed execution** - Policies are compiled to WebAssembly and run in a secure sandbox
- **Extensible signals** - Gather real-time context from Git, CI, DB metadata, feature flags, and more
