# Minimal guidebook - only custom signals (scripts are auto-discovered)

signals:
  # Override the test_status script with inline command
  test_status:
    command: "echo '{\"passing\": false, \"coverage\": 85}'"
    timeout_seconds: 5
  
  # Git branch uses the auto-discovered script
  # git_branch: auto-discovered from signals/git_branch.sh

# Actions are auto-discovered from actions/ directory by rule_id
