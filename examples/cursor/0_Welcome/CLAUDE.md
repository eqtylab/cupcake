# Cursor Context

This directory is a Cupcake policy evaluation environment for testing security policies with Cursor.

## Environment

You are running in a controlled demo environment with:
- **Cupcake Policy Engine** active - your actions are being monitored and evaluated
- **Security policies** preventing dangerous operations
- **File protection** blocking access to sensitive files
- **Database protection** (when MCP demo is active)

## Available Tools

### Shell Commands
- Safe commands like `ls`, `echo`, `cat` are allowed
- Dangerous commands like `rm -rf`, `sudo` are blocked
- Git operations are monitored (no `--no-verify` allowed)

### File Operations
- Can read and edit most project files
- Cannot access: `.ssh/`, `.aws/`, `.env` files
- Cannot modify: `/etc/`, `/System/`, `.cupcake/` directories

### Database (if MCP is enabled)
- PostgreSQL database: `appointments`
- Can SELECT/query data
- Cannot DELETE records
- Cannot cancel appointments within 24 hours

## Testing the Policies

Try these operations to see policies in action:

**Will be blocked:**
- `rm -rf /tmp/test`
- `sudo apt update`
- Reading `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
- Modifying `.cupcake/policies/`
- `git commit --no-verify`

**Will work:**
- `ls -la`
- `echo "test"`
- Reading project files
- `git status`
- Creating new files in the project

## Policy Feedback

When your actions are blocked, you'll receive:
1. A user-friendly message explaining why
2. Technical guidance on alternatives (visible in your context)

Example: If you try `sudo`, you'll get detailed suggestions about alternatives like using Docker or modifying permissions.

## Important Notes

- **Do not attempt to bypass security policies** - they protect the system
- **The `.cupcake/` directory is protected** - policies cannot be modified through Cursor
- **All actions are logged** for security audit purposes

## Getting Help

If you need to perform a blocked action:
1. Check if there's a safer alternative
2. Ask the user to perform it manually
3. Explain why the action is blocked and what alternatives exist
