This cupcake example repository demonstrates policies that incorporate PostgreSQL signals. Signals enable you to gather additional context that you need within the rule enforcement layer of Cupcake. You use signals when an agent's action in isolation does not provide full context on its own. For instance, when Claude Code attempts to execute database queries, the query alone doesn't tell you about connection limits, database load, or whether you're on a production instance. We gather this additional context via Cupcake's signal system.
