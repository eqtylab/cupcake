This cupcake example repository demonstrates policies that incorporate Next.js signals. Signals enable you to gather additional context that you need within the rule enforcement layer of Cupcake. You use signals when an agent's action in isolation does not provide full context on its own. For instance, when Claude Code attempts to deploy or build a Next.js application, the command alone doesn't tell you about test status, build health, or security vulnerabilities. We gather this additional context via Cupcake's signal system.
