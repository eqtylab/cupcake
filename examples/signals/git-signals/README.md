This cupcake example repository demonstrates policies that incorporate Git signals. Signals enable you to gather additional context that you need within the rule enforcement layer of Cupcake. You use signals when an agent's action in isolation does not provide full context on its own. For instance, when Claude Code attempts to execute Git operations, the command alone doesn't tell you the current branch, repository state, or whether there are uncommitted changes. We gather this additional context via Cupcake's signal system.
