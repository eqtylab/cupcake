This cupcake example repository demonstrates how to integrate NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails into your policy decisions. Cupcake's signal system has dual-use capability: beyond gathering context, signals can conduct evaluations by delegating to existing industry guardrails. When Claude Code attempts an action, we can pass that information to NeMo Guardrails for evaluation, then use the result in our Rego policy with simple checks like `input.signals.nemo_evaluation.passed == true`. This shows how Cupcake orchestrates existing guardrail systems rather than competing with them.
